## Summary
 In the discussion, users explored issues with integrating AI models into their projects using vvaifu as a no-code interface, specifically encountering errors when attempting to use the OKai/OK framework for Discord servers. Bel shared his struggle in connecting to Twitter and resolved it by correcting import statements and specifying Clients.DISCORD correctly. The community also addressed problems with AI models exceeding token limits, as highlighted by uber's error message regarding max tokens when using the Opus model. Suggestions were made about wiping agent Twitter feeds to observe behavior changes or considering alternative models that comply with output token limitations.

## FAQ
 - How did Bel finally connect to Twitter?
  - Bel: After ensuring the correct imports (changing typed out 'client' to 'clients') and using Clients.DISCORD as the value for clients=, I managed to successfully connect to my Twitter account.
- Is there a Docker version available for vvaifu?
  - Ploutarch: The question was raised about whether there is a Docker version of vvaifu, but no clear answer was provided in the conversation.
- What could be causing the issue with max tokens exceeding the limit when using Opus model?
  - uber: After experiencing an error related to max_tokens being greater than the allowed number for claude-3-opus-20240229, a question was raised about whether connecting it with a different model or reducing the maxOutputTokens to 4096 would be potential workarounds. No clear answer was provided in the conversation.

## Who Helped Who
 - SwarmyDaniels helped YoungPhlo with running pnpm build by suggesting to look into vvaifu's default model.
- Bel helped himself by troubleshooting connection issues, ensuring correct imports and using Clients.DISCORD as a value for clients= in his Twitter bot project.
- Ploutarch sought help regarding unclear documentation on OKai/OK framework and asked if there's a Docker version available to possibly simplify the setup process.
- uber shared their issue with an agent's Twitter spazzing out, seeking advice from others who might have encountered similar problems or solutions.
