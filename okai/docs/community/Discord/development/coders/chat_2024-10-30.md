## Summary
 In the discussion, LevelsDennis shared his experience with Audio's extension tool, praising its potential despite it not being fully realized yet. Big Dookie expressed interest in neural amp modeling technology and advocated for free music production tools that allow easy training and upload of models by users. He highlighted Tonex as a platform where thousands of models are available but noted the lack of freedom due to costs associated with training. Dnx sought advice on training OKai, an AI character, using a new dataset. The conversation emphasized the importance of accessible technology for music production and the community's desire for open-source solutions that democratize model creation without financial barriers.

## FAQ
 - How can I ask Lyra anything about stable audio tools in the MusicGen Discord?
  - big dookie: Go to musicgen discord and message Lyra with your queries regarding stable audio tools, as she is an expert on this topic.
- What are some impressive features of Audio's extension tool that LevelsDennis experienced while working with a client?
  - LevelsDennis: The tool can copy guitar tones, production styles, and multiple dialects in different languages, although it still needs improvement to reach its full potential.
- How does the neural amp modeler work, and what makes it appealing for music producers like big dookie?
  - big dookie: The neural amp modeler allows easy training and uploading of models by users, making it accessible and free for everyone to use. This feature is particularly attractive as it enables experimentation without the need for credits or paid subscriptions.
- What are some concerns regarding the ease of training a new character for OKai?
  - big dookie: Training a good model can be challenging, even with provided guidance and videos on setting up Docker composes. It may still be too difficult for most people to train effectively or spin up their own models.
