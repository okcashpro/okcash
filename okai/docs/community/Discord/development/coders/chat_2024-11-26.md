## Summary
 In the discussion, users tackled technical challenges such as editing TS being difficult, issues with signing wallet addresses using Solflare with Ledger in a Dao fun platform, and installing ffi-napi node-gyp-build on WSL 2. They also debated between different methods for starting the application, like using `pnpm start --characters` or editing `defaultCharacter.ts`. A thread was started to address logging into Twitter via CLI for bot cookies, with a user experiencing repeated issues despite troubleshooting and restarting from scratch. On iOS, there were questions about needing sudo permissions. The conversation also included an announcement of a shared agent badge on Twitter by @razor who contributed to an OKai list project through a PR.

## FAQ

- Alpha sought advice on installing ffi-napi node-gyp-build within WSL 2 environment; RL confirmed the options provided by coinwitch were correct but also mentioned a preference for JSON files, though it's not clear if this resolved Alpha's issue.
- N00t asked about logging into Twitter via CLI to get cookies for bot usage on an Ubuntu VPS; RL started a thread presumably to gather more information or solutions, indicating the help was in progress but not yet complete.
