## Summary
 During the chat, participants engaged in technical discussions regarding token swap functionality issues, with a TypeError reported when attempting to read '_bn' properties of undefined objects. Ophiuchus confirmed that despite these challenges, the swap feature operates correctly. The community explored various APIs like Helius and Birdeye for potential integration into their projects, as evidenced by Jin's inquiries about GitHub repositories related to code2prompt. Slim suggested a loading or network issue might be causing delays in dashboard UV map rendering, while Tenji sought clarification on initiating token swaps using OKai's sister feature. Ophiuchus confirmed the process and mentioned testing transaction functionality with pull request #239 from OK/okai. Bless expressed interest in documenting an end-to-end setup for an OKai Twitter bot, including a bounty offer to cover comprehensive tutorials on using OKai across different platforms like Twitter, Discord, and Telegram. Ophiuchus agreed to create the tutorial with a focus on thoroughness, especially regarding Twitter integration.

## FAQ
 - What is the error encountered during token swap?
  - Ophiuchus: The error "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '_bn')" occurs when trying to perform a token swap. This issue might be related to an incomplete or incorrect implementation in the codebase, which needs further investigation.
- How can one set up an OKai Twitter bot from start to finish?
  - Ophiuchus: To document and create a setup guide for an OKai Twitter bot on the latest build, you would need to cover aspects like initializing the project, adding twitting cookies (which should be obtained during the first run), and setting up end-to-end integration with Twitter. The process can also include other platforms such as Discord and Telegram if desired.
- What is the difference between helius and birdeye APIs?
  - Ophiuchus: Both Helius and Birdeye are Solana wallet extensions, but they have different features and user interfaces. While specific differences were not mentioned in the conversation, it's recommended to explore their respective documentation or GitHub repositories for more information on how they differ from each other.
