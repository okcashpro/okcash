## Summary
The Discord chat segment focused on technical discussions related to OKai's capabilities and project setup. Key points included using the latest node version, pnpm for dependency management, investigating independent conversation initiation across different platforms (Twitter, TG, Discord), resolving issues with 'pnpm start --characters', addressing errors during 'pnpm build', preserving memory between runs to avoid repeated responses on Twitter.

## FAQ
- Is OKai capable of initiating conversation without being mentioned first on Twitter, TG and Discord? Or is it always possible but I missed it before? (asked by [razzzz])
- Why does pnpm start --characters keep trying to use local model when specifying Anthropic as the modelProvider and inputting API in .env files? How can I resolve this? (asked by [gavinlouuu])
- Is there a way for OKai to preserve memory between runs, so it doesn't re-respond with the same Twitter comments after each restart? How can I achieve this? (asked by [technoir (01:12)])
- Which parts of Nadarâ€™s video on OKai have been adjusted already to avoid errors during 'pnpm build' using the latest checkout command? Is it .env file, character file or both? (asked by [Robin (01:14)])
- What are the steps required for deploying an agent and how much does it cost? (with Twitter only?) (asked by @Clive0x1)
- I'm getting errors while doing pnpm build. Any ideas? (asked by @Mansi | SuperFunSocial)
- Are you working on video generation with an API? (asked by @umut)
- Are there any sessions planned for learning to navigate the repo? Who can help with character customization and deployment on OKai platform? What time zone is AIFlow.ML in, Asia or relative Crypto timezone? (asked by Kenk)
- How do I fix this error when launching an agent using your framework: Failed at node_modules/.pnpm/canvas@2.11.2/node_modules/canvas? What's the image model provider being used, core or plugin one? (asked by maimun)
- Is the API endpoint not included in standard package and is a paid feature? Answered by @Bunchu (asked by @jjj)
