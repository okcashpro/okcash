## Summary
 In the chat, Cyfer785 sought assistance for creating a frontend interface that would display AI-generated content in a retro style with live scrolling text, reminiscent of Claude's capabilities but tailored to their own AI pipe output. DegenSpartan and Poe engaged in the conversation, suggesting that Cyfer785 was essentially attempting to replicate features from existing projects like Infinite Backrooms and Claude without adding original value. The discussion highlighted a divergence of interests as Cyfer785's vision did not align with what DegenSpartan and Poe were willing or able to provide, leading to the conclusion that they were not suitable collaborators for this project. Despite some initial enthusiasm from other participants like astr0x., who humorously claimed a share of non-existent profits, the technical focus remained on Cyfer785's request for a unique AI interface development.
