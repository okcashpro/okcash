## Summary
 In the discussion, participants explored various technical solutions for tunneling, with Cloudflare Tunnel being recommended as a free option worth checking out. The official Telegram client's functionality was confirmed to work by Ophiuchus after resolving issues caused by including optional dependencies during installation. A pull request on GitHub introduced verbose logging configuration options for the OKai project. Discussions also touched upon scraping configurations, with parameters like max tweets, retries, delays, and verbosity being considered. Additionally, Deniz brought up an issue regarding a discord client agent's interaction error in channels where it couldn't send messages. The conversation concluded with Trophy announcing plans to share resources based on the group's contributions.

## FAQ
 - Is the official Telegram client functioning properly?
  - Ophiuchus: Yes, it works fine after installing with `pnpm i` command and resolving an issue related to running `pnpm install --include=optional sharp`.
- How can one configure their bot to always respond to users on Twitter?
  - Ophiuchus: You should use the `thenShouldRespond()` method for the Telegram client, allowing you to change the prompt and make it always respond to users.
- What are some tips or configurations needed when setting up a TG bot key that doesn't answer back with anything?
