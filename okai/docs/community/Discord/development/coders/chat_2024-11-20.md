## FAQ
 - What is the LCID table?
  - Lawyered.eth: The LCID (Locale ID) table contains information related to locales used in software applications for internationalization purposes. It helps manage language, region, and cultural preferences across different platforms or systems.
- How can I apply for auth settings in the Twitter API?
  - Mikekme: To access certain features like tweeting with a specific character limit using the Twitter API, you may need to apply for authentication settings. This typically involves creating an app on the Twitter Developer Platform and filling out necessary details such as your application's name, description, website URL, etc.
- What are some resources available in the environment file if I don't want to use the Twitter API?
  - MI A MI: There are alternative resources or libraries that can be used instead of directly using the Twitter API. These resources might include pre-built functions and utilities for handling social media interactions, which you can find in your project's environment file (env).
- How to fix a SQL error when switching to Node 22?
  - SotoAlt | WAWE: The user encountered an issue with a SQL error after upgrading their system to Node version 22. They resolved the problem by making changes in their code, but they didn't specify what those changes were. It might be helpful for others facing similar issues to look into potential breaking changes between different versions of Node and adjust their code accordingly.
- How can I resolve an error fetching response due to invalid JSON?
  - Only1: The user encountered a SyntaxError while trying to parse a response that was not valid JSON, with the message "Agent not found."
