## Summary
The chat focused on technical discussions about hosting OKai, adjusting the twitter scraper for original tweets only and choosing a character at login. Kanye faced an issue with looping errors while using grok & openai APIs.

## FAQ
- Why is the same tweet being checked over and over again with warning signs still showing? Using grok & openai, but terminal works fine. Any ideas why this happens on Twitter only (00:34)? Answered by:[SotoAlt | WAWE] (asked by [Kanye])
- What's the best Discord channel to find developers looking for work and joining a team? How can I do this without breaking any rules? (asked by @T)
- How does your AWS Lambda worker handle distributed, live responses when needed while keeping wallet access air-gapped with only client DB connection (and possibly an event bus if required)? (asked by :okaisalute:)

- Why does SQLITE throw an error when inputting image? (asked by [VI](05:22))
- Does anyone have a suggestion for how to integrate this into the starter - when I try to download the package from GitHub directly, I get bunch of type and other errors?
Odilitime (05:47): You can runs an agent without any token... Starter relies on npm being at same tag.
ÍßÅNinja_DevÍßÇ(05:48): But lets say, I do have a token and its on EVM. Seems like either way the token is separate from the agent?
If so you just tie in the token... Odilitime (05:49)... Jacob (06:12) (asked by @Jacob)
- Does AI16 have support for something like VIRTUALS' Roblox Westwood game? Specifically wondering how their ai agents can make decisions in a seemingly continuous space, such as moving to X location and shooting in Y direction, in real time. Where should I go ask this question or do you have a link to the game? (asked by @Bullish)
- Do you understand my previous query? Do you have any suggestions on how easy it is to build a game integration with AI16's stack, and what documentation/support exists for this process? (asked by @Bullish)
