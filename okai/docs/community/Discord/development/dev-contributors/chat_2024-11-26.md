## Summary
 In the Discord chat, Odilitime requested an update from jin on issue 617 in the GitHub repository for project okai, which was promptly completed by jin. The conversation then shifted to Galego's implementation of a cache manager resembling a file system for media storage within agent folders; however, this feature wasn't added due to complexity concerns at that point. Odilitime suggested each plugin could utilize a similar file structure approach and noted the Twitter-client also writes tweets to a file cache. The key technical discussion revolved around caching strategies and potential standardization across plugins using file structures for media storage, with an emphasis on simplicity and efficiency in implementation.

## FAQ
 - How can we update the GitHub issue linked in the chat?
  - jin: The GitHub issue has been updated as requested by Odilitime.
- What is a simple way to implement a cache manager for media files from an agent?
  - Galego: Implementing a file manager where all media goes into a folder can be a straightforward approach, but it was not added due to complexity concerns in the PR (Pull Request).
- Can each plugin use its own file structure for caching purposes?
  - Odilitime: Yes, each plugin could utilize an independent file structure for caching. This is similar to how the Twitter client writes tweets to a file cache.

## Who Helped Who
 - Jin helped Odilitime with updating GitHub issues by completing the task as requested.
- Galego helped other community members (implied) by sharing their approach to implementing a cache manager, which could be useful for others facing similar challenges in managing media files within an agent system.

- Feature Requests
  - Implement a cache manager similar to a simple file manager for media from the agent, but with consideration of not adding complexity if it's already too much (mentioned by Galego)
