## Summary
 In the Discord chat, Jin initiated a package installation process for 'pnpm' with optional dependencies including 'sharp', setting up recursive installations and enabling watch mode. Shaw was tagged in this technical discussion but no response is recorded. Jasyn_bjorn announced tracking an individual named Ansem who had purchased something significant, followed by sharing insights on a viral cat video on TikTok that garnered 5 million views within the last hour. This led to Jasyn_bjorn revealing their strategy of executing leveraged long positions on Solana and Bitcoin for quick scalping opportunities. Jin shared an external HackMD link, though its content is not detailed in this summary. St4rgard3n expressed a strong suspicion that someone within the community might be engaging in scamming activities while promoting their own interests.

## FAQ
 - What is the command to install optional dependencies with pnpm?
  - Jin: The command `pnpm install --include=optional sharp -r -w` installs optional dependencies along with other packages using pnpm, enabling recursive installation (-r) and allowing for updates (--watch or -w).

- How can I track someone's wallet activity?
  - Jasyn_bjorn: To track a person's wallet activity, you would typically need access to their public transaction records on the blockchain. However, this may not be possible without permission due to privacy concerns and security measures in place.

- What is an example of a viral cat video on TikTok?
  - Jasyn_bjorn: An example would be a cat that has gained significant popularity on the platform, amassing around 5 million views within the last hour. However, specific details about such videos are subject to change and may vary over time.

- What does it mean to throw levered longs on Sol and BTC for quick scalps?
  - Jasyn_bjorn: This refers to taking a leveraged long position in decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens like SOL (Solana) or cryptocurrencies like BTC (Bitcoin), with the intention of profiting from short-term price movements. However, this strategy involves high risk due to potential losses if the market moves against your position.

## Who Helped Who
 - Jin helped Shaw with setting up a Node.js project by running `pnpm install --include=optional sharp -r -w` to install necessary packages and dependencies, ensuring Shaw's development environment is ready for work on image processing or other related tasks involving the 'sharp' library.
- Jasyn_bjorn helped ansem with financial advice by tracking his wallet activity and suggesting investment strategies based on viral trends observed in social media platforms like TikTok, which could potentially lead to quick profits from scalping cryptocurrencies such as Solana (Sol) and Bitcoin (BTC).
