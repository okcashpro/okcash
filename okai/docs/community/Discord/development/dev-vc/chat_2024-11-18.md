## Summary
 In the Discord chat, participants explored self-hosting options for fibery.io and linear.app's free version, with discussions on potential feature additions through funding and implementing voting systems for leadership roles. The conversation highlighted locality as a powerful concept, suggesting a combination of Y Combinator and Andreessen Horowitz models to enhance the platform. Jin mentioned two developers from defined.fi who have access to extensive data, including active chats, but noted deficiencies in marketing and social engagement. The group expressed interest in leveraging this data for AI training to identify potential scams or "rugs" in trading platforms like Dexscreener, which was reported as completed. Proposals were suggested to outline timelines, expectations, and mutual benefits between the parties involved. Additionally, there were technical issues with audio management on Discord, including unsuccessful attempts to update an 'audio' cog that does not exist in a repository by that name. The chat also referenced GitHub contributions to OKai projects and community milestones related to defined.fi and Pmairca integration efforts.
