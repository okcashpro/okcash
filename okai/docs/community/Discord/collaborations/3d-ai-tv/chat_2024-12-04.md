## Summary
The chat segment revolves around the community members discussing their creative projects, specifically focusing on making scenes inspired by various artists. Boom shared a scene they created and suggested creating another one based on Nam June Paik's TV arrangements.

## FAQ
- Could you make an endpoint that returns the trailer review in 1 JSON object? (Then I can convert it to one of these show scripts on the fly with another AI call.) (asked by [SM Sith Lord](08:40))
- Can we pull JSON from a URL? Can Firebase real-time database be used instead of something more local? (asked by [SM Sith Lord, 08:42])
- Do I need markers for phenoms? Do you just need the audio & length to do that? (asked by boom)
- Would delivering phenoms work best if 3D stage handles TTS, and can it handle real-time processing of an interrupted scream from a window? (asked by sm sith lord)
- Can we play the show directly in a web page? Why would it be slow comedy if there's no multi-thread voice support? What are visemes and how can they replace audio eventually? (asked by [SM Sith Lord])
- How does each scene maintain its unique vibe with only four characters, considering the limitations of Unity integration for now? (asked by [boom](08:49))
- How does the web page app running on your PC talk to the Unity app running on your PC? How can I implement this communication efficiently, considering my limited development skills and time constraints? (asked by [whobody](08:51))
- How do we handle updates in our JSON file within the Unity script to ensure only new events are processed? What's an efficient way of doing this without overloading resources or causing delays? (asked by [boom](08:53))
- 'Unity can support it?' referring to the Unity showrunner web page app with AI calls via node.js server and Claude & OpenAI APIs (asked by [boom (08:54)])
- Will SM use Firebase or host on a website for their project? (asked by [SM Sith Lord (08:54)])
