## Summary
The main technical discussion revolved around handling events in a specific order based on timestamps. Boom shared code for processing these events and managing their respective methods, while also addressing concerns about duplicate event calls during testing.

## FAQ
- How is the timestamp management and method calling based on event type handled? Is there a need to run tests again or skip processed events in order? (asked by @SM Sith Lord)
- Is another 'speakComplete' handling method needed, similar to prepareSceneCompleteEvent() ? (asked by @SM Sith Lord)

## Who Helped Who
- @SM Sith Lord helped [Discord Channel Members] with Event Processing by providing Boom provided code for event processing and timestamp management.
