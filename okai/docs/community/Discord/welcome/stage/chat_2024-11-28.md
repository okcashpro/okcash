## Summary
The discussion focused primarily around implementing Lit Protocol's tech (mpc sharding) in the decentralized network of OKai. A new community member (@Cheelax | zKorp ☁), onboarding to OKai, sought advice for hosting an instance and understanding agent-client interactions.

## FAQ
- - What it implies to pass the providers like in yesterday's video? Is data ingested automatically by agent? (asked by @Cheelax | zKorp ☁ (00:04))
- -What solution would you advise for hosting an okai instance, is vps simpler option? (asked by @Cheelax | zKorp ☁(00:05))
- - What endpoints are exposed after pnpm start when clients interact with agents? - @shaw if you have some chill time during the call. (asked by @Cheelax | zKorp ☁ (00:14))
- Have you been to #☣-price-talk-trenches? Are there any useful insights from that discussion? (asked by @Zardique)
- Could the multi-metric approach with AI summary be viable for agent evaluation in Discord channel discussions and GitHub code comparisons? (asked by @jin)
- How can we prevent flooding issues while escalating good questions from our chat to Issue Tracker? (asked by @boom)
- How can we resolve wallet provider errors? What configurations are missing for SOLANA_PUBLIC_KEY and EVM_PRIVATE_KEY to function properly? (asked by @ShakkerNerd)

## Who Helped Who
- Cheelax | zKorp ☁ helped New member onboarding OKai, seeking guidance and support. with Providing advice for hosting an okai instance by providing @st4rgard3n (00:12)
- @boom (01:32) helped YoungPhlo with Improving PR by providing Zardique provided a feature suggestion for an agent that reviews code discussions and compares them with GitHub codes.
- @ShakkerNerd helped  with Feature Requests by providing @YoungPhlo provided guidance on resolving the issue with imageGen feature delay by suggesting opening a separate PR for it.

## Action Items

### Technical Tasks
- Implement Lit Protocol's tech on OKai for mpc sharding (mentioned by @st4rgard3n)
- Implement a multi-metric approach with AI summary for agent evaluation (mentioned by @boom (00:23))
- Escalate good questions from the Discord channel to Issue Tracker (mentioned by @boom (00:32))
- Fix wallet provider error by configuring SOLANA_PUBLIC_KEY (mentioned by @YoungPhlo)
- Resolve EVM wallet provider issue with missing configuration for EVM_PRIVATE_KEY. (mentioned by @ShakkerNerd)

### Documentation Needs
- Host an okai instance, consider using vps as a simpler option. (mentioned by @Cheelax | zKorp ☁)

### Feature Requests
- Develop an agent that reviews code discussions and compares them to GitHub codes, rewarding points accordingly. (mentioned by @Zardique (00:35))
- Optimize message response generation time and address imageGen feature delay on Twitter updates. Open a PR to tackle these issues separately from the main branch. (mentioned by @YoungPhlo)
