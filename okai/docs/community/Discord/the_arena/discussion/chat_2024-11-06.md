## FAQ
 - What is the reason behind the discrepancy between assets under management (AUM) and token market cap?
  - [coinwitch (OK intern)]: The AUM consists of initial Solana raised, DAO-bought DeGenAI, and random contributions to the wallet. Market cap reflects speculation on future developments.

- Can someone explain why there's a significant difference between assets in the wallet (AUM) and token market capitalization?
  - [coinwitch (OK intern)]: AUM includes initial funds, DAO purchases, and contributions, while market cap is based on speculation about what the project will achieve.
