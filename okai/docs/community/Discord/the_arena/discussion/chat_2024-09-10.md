## Summary
 In the Discord chat, users shared their experiences with AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude for work-related tasks. Shaw highlighted a significant moment when pasting an entire codebase into one of these systems resulted in successful execution, marking a milestone in leveraging AI for coding efficiency. Additionally, metapontum pointed out the lack of clipboard functionality in VNC applications as of 2024 and resorted to using AutoHotkey scripts to address this gap. The conversation also touched on Shaw's preference for silent coding and building processes, indicating a broader theme of seeking productivity enhancements through AI integration while acknowledging the need for workarounds in current software limitations.

## FAQ
 - When did you feel like you activated God-mode with your prompts?
  - Red Rhino: This question is more of a rhetorical one rather than seeking an answer from others in the chat, so no clear explanation can be provided here.

- How was it when you pasted all your codebase and it worked seamlessly?
  - Shaw (13:13:16): The user shared their experience of successfully using a tool like ChatGPT or similar AI for work, where they were able to paste in their entire codebase and have the system understand and execute it without issues. This indicates that the tool was effective at handling complex coding tasks.

- What is your approach when you want to build silently?
  - Shaw (19:04:40): The user mentioned using a silent mode while coding, which could be useful for others who prefer not to have distractions or interruptions during their work process. However, the explanation of how they achieve this is not provided in the chat transcript.

- Why don't VNC applications support clipboard functionality?
  - Metapontum (19:44:14): The user expressed frustration with Virtual Network Computing (VNC) applications lacking a feature to use the clipboard, which is essential for many tasks in remote desktop environments. This question highlights an area where VNC applications could improve their functionality and usability.

- How do you manage clipboard usage without built-in support from your VNC application?
  - Metapontum (19:44:59): The user shared that they resort to using AutoHotkey scripts in the year 2024, which implies a workaround for managing clipboard functionality when it's not natively supported by their chosen remote desktop tool. This could be helpful information for others facing similar issues with VNC applications and looking for alternative solutions.

## Who Helped Who
 - Shaw helped fellow coders with debugging by sharing a pasted codebase that worked successfully.
- Metapontum highlighted an issue in VNC applications not supporting clipboard functionality, indirectly helping others recognize this limitation and possibly seek alternative solutions or workarounds like using AutoHotkey scripts.
