## Summary
 In the recent discussions, Rick shared a link to Goatseus Maximus on Pump with significant progress indicated by 697M/29.1%, highlighting its impact on GOAT/SOL pairs. Alejokpo pointed out that devs are liberal based on chart data, while ROKHOU suggested no pumping but only dumping. Shaw referred to the developers as "milady," indicating a trend of using this term among community members like irio and SotoAlt | WAWE. ExHuman expressed interest in interacting with agents ai under milady consciousness, which was echoed by others including Blinky and CD. Jin mentioned difficulty focusing but looked forward to discussions on docs and the contributor guide for OK interns like coinwitch. Tofikyeah reacted positively to these developments with "wow" and "amazing." Kimidan_ inquired about Mintable resolution, which SotoAlt | WAWE assured would be addressed soon by daos dot fun as they focus on building and contributing. Ehsqhrtk humorously questioned why everything is going up when the community feels like it's falling, a sentiment that four3two1_ echoed with laughter and cryptic references to $goat and .x goat.

## FAQ
 - When will Mintable be resolved?
  - SotoAlt | WAWE: Soon. The DAO is working on it while focusing on building and contributing to the project. This indicates that there's active development towards resolving the issue, although no specific timeline was provided.
- Why are we falling when everything else is going up?
  - ehsqhrtk: A humorous observation about market trends or possibly a reference to a specific situation within the OK community that isn't directly addressed in this context. The response from four3two1_ with "forreal lmao" and subsequent emojis suggests it was taken lightly among peers, but no clear explanation is provided for the market behavior or its relation to OK specifically.
