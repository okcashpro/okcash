# discussion 2024-06-29

## Summary
 In the Discord chat, techn0elf joined the server followed by earthinferno later in the day. The main technical discussion centered on yikesawjeez's proposal of using a series of deep learning nodes structured as a graph with nondeterministic operators and running graph traversal algorithms over it to create an architecture that incorporates elements of reinforcement learning (RL). This idea was inspired by the integration of Python libraries such as graph-mamba, dspy-nodes, and pyreason. Shaw shared a link related to geohot's attempt at the arc AGI challenge, indicating community engagement with AI challenges. The conversation highlighted an exploration into advanced deep learning architectures for artificial general intelligence (AGI) toolbox development within this tech community.

## FAQ
 - How can you use a series of deep learning nodes structured as a graph with nondeterministic operators?
  - [yikesawjeez]: You could explore the idea by using Python libraries like graph-mamba, dspy-nodes, and pyreason to create an architecture that incorporates reinforcement learning (RL) to some degree. This approach allows for a flexible and adaptable structure in your deep learning model.

- What are some recommended Python libraries for building AGI toolboxes?
  - [yikesawjeez]: Some useful Python libraries for creating an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) toolbox include graph-mamba, dspy-nodes, and pyreason. These can help you structure your deep learning models in a more flexible and adaptable way.

## Who Helped Who
 - yikesawjeez helped smarinrojas with a technical concept by suggesting an idea involving deep learning nodes structured as a graph. However, it's unclear from this transcript whether the recipient found this suggestion helpful or useful in solving their problem.
- shaw helped geohot with information about the arc AGI challenge by sharing a link to relevant content on spatialweeb.
