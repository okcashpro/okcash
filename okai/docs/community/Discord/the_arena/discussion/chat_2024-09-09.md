## Summary
 In the Discord chat, metapontum and shaw engaged in an insightful discussion on collective intelligence and its role in achieving AGI, with a focus on mechanisms that streamline agent collaboration. They explored ideas such as using multiple agents to analyze code repositories for building client applications across social platforms, acknowledging the limitations of current LLM-based agent technology but recognizing its utility when functional. Metapontum shared his work on creating desktops and VMs with MITM proxies that automatically inject API keys into HTTP requests, enhancing parallel development approaches. Shaw suggested scraping API keys from GitHub as a manual alternative to metapontum's automated method. They discussed the potential of using NFS for shared VM storage and considered the challenges of rapid agent prototyping versus traditional methods like cloning Git repositories. The conversation also touched on the importance of infrastructure, such as live-migration technology, in facilitating efficient development processes. Metapontum highlighted the need to address issues that arise when scaling up parallel agents and emphasized the value of tools that simplify complexity for newcomers.

## FAQ
 - What is the real solution to AGI according to metapontum?
  - [metapontum]: The real solution will likely be a mechanism that streamlines the instrumentality & combination of other agents, rather than one single builder's solution leading to AGI.
- How does Shaw view the future of AGI development?
  - [shaw]: AGI will probably involve several clauses and advanced models working together to analyze how clients were built for social platforms, possibly scraping API keys from GitHub too.
- What is metapontum currently working on in terms of agent technology?
  - [metapontum]: Metapontum is working on automatically creating desktops, cloning entire state environments, and using a MITM proxy running on VMs to inject API keys into HTTP requests automatically. This allows for parallel approaches when an agent uses environment variables like 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'.
- How does metapontum plan to handle the storage issue with multiple sandboxes?
  - [metapontum]: Metapontum plans to use NFS (Network File System) to address the storage limitations that arise when each sandbox needs its own installation of everything. This will allow for more agents running in parallel without being fundamentally limited by storage issues.

## Who Helped Who
 - Shaw helped Metapontum with understanding AGI development by discussing potential approaches, including parallel attempts and leveraging existing open source agents.
- Metapontum helped Shaw with insights into infrastructure challenges for rapid prototyping of AI agents by explaining live migration of running devices and the importance of NFS for storage solutions in sandboxed environments.
