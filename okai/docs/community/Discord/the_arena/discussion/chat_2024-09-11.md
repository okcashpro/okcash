## Summary
 In the Discord chat, Shaw announced plans to stream on Grey Area AI's platform while working there, sparking a discussion led by PeePa regarding hosting bots under the condition they are not annoying. Technical discussions ensued with Nisten sharing resources related to hypergraph transformers: an arXiv paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.09657v2), a review on Papers With Code (https://paperswithcode.com/paper/topology-guided-hypergraph-transformer/review/), and the GitHub repository for ZeroXLeo's HyperGT implementation (https://github.com/zeroxleo/hypergt). These resources indicate a focus on advancing machine learning techniques, specifically in hypergraph transformers, which could be an area of interest or development within their community.

## FAQ
 - Can we host our bots here?
  - Shaw: Yes, you can host your bots as long as they are not annoying or disruptive to the community.
- What is the topic of the blog post linked in this chat (https://lalalune.github.io/blog/On-Being-Remembered/)?
  - Shaw: The blog post discusses the importance of being remembered and how it relates to personal branding, marketing, and social media presence.
- What is the arXiv paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.09657v2) about?
  - Nisten: The arXiv paper focuses on a new approach called Topology Guided Hypergraph Transformer, which addresses challenges in hypergraph representation learning and improves performance across various tasks.
- What is the GitHub repository (https://github.com/zeroxleo/hypergt) related to?
  - Nisten: The GitHub repository contains an implementation of the Topology Guided Hypergraph Transformer model, which can be used for research or experimentation in hypergraph representation learning tasks.

## Who Helped Who
 - Shaw helped PeePa with bot hosting by providing a condition for their presence on the platform.
- Nisten helped Shaw with information sharing by posting links to relevant blog posts, research papers, and GitHub repositories related to memory and hypergraph transformers.

## Action Items
