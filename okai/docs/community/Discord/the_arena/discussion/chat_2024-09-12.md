## Summary
 In the Discord chat, Shaw invited Narcraft to join him on Gather Town for streaming, coworking, and discussions related to ARC (Automated Reasoning Competition). Upon joining, Narcraft shared his current exploration of ARC-related GitHub repositories and sought information about existing work or notes that could aid in understanding the competition. Shaw recommended Hodel's DSL for ARC, which is part of the MindsAI team, providing a direct link to the repository. Later, Narcraft expressed interest in testing an example with ChatGPT, sharing his results and curiosity about its overall performance. Shaw responded by mentioning that running it in assistant mode yielded satisfactory but slower results compared to Hodel's approach. The conversation highlighted technical discussions on ARC resources, decisions regarding the use of specific tools for problem-solving, and shared achievements within their community related to improving performance in tackling ARC challenges.
