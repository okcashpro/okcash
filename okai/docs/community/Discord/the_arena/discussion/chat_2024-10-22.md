## Summary
 In the server chat, Mohamed Ryad announced his joining followed by 0xjune_'s arrival. The_magician proposed adding a new agent to the team, which Shaw agreed to invite after receiving an application ID or URL. Void Basilisk and several others joined shortly thereafter. LevelsDennis humorously suggested that they should promote their project with memes on Twitter for increased visibility. Discussions about AI behavior revealed concerns over rate limiting in Discord, as well as a tendency to ignore certain inputs due to correlated architecture issues. Elijah Madonia noted the use of question marks by an AI and compared it to workplace training scenarios with voice assistants like Substackers. The server welcomed new members throughout the evening, including Cryptolaise, paradoxical, Smokin_Dave_007, stoneofjordan, Mr. Leon, and CalgoatEra, marking a significant community milestone with their arrivals.
