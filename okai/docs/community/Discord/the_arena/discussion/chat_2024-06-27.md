## Summary
 In the Discord chat, Samuel expressed interest in forming a team while Andy Brock joined the server. Yikesawjeez shared an article on achieving high scores with GPT-4 on arc-agi games and showed willingness to contribute until their contract ends. Kabir Kumar announced a mech interp speedrun scheduled for July, and loveofdoing discussed transformer memorization capabilities in response to various input/output combinations of Hilbert wave curves. Shaw shared an arXiv paper related to the topic and confirmed George Hotz's suggestion that Transformers with reinforcement learning could be a potential solution. Virgile Blais joined the server, Corona_Chan proposed applying facial video-to-ECG/PPG prediction models for arc tasks using Hilbert wave curves as inputs/outputs, and Arch2230 offered to collaborate on live hack sessions over weekends with goo14_.

## FAQ
 - How can we form a team?
  - SSamuel: The user expressed interest in forming a team but did not receive any direct answers or suggestions on how to proceed with the formation of the team.

- What is icymi, and where can I find more information about it?
  - yikesawjeez: icymi refers to an article on LessWrong titled "Getting 50 Sota on Arc AGI With GPT-4o." The user shared a link for further reading.

- What is the purpose of holding a mech interp speedrun in July?
  - Kabir Kumar: The user mentioned organizing an event called "mech interp speedrun" but did not provide details on its purpose or how it relates to the chat's context.

- How does the transformer memorize input data, and is this a concern for our project?
  - loveofdoing: The user asked about the potential of a transformer model memorizing input data but did not receive any direct answers in the chat transcript.

- What are some relevant papers or resources to learn more about the topic discussed?
  - shaw: Shaw provided two links, one pointing to an arXiv paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.11502) and another to a preprint version of a different paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06483v1).

- How would George Hotz approach solving the problem at hand?
  - shaw: Shaw mentioned that they asked George Hotz for his opinion, and he suggested using transformers with some kind of reinforcement learning (RL) reward function. However, this is not a confirmed solution but rather an interesting idea shared by George Hotz.

## Who Helped Who
 - yikesawjeez helped Andy Brock with joining a team by expressing interest in participating and offering to keep up to date until their contract ends.
- Kabir Kumar helped community members interested in mech interpretation speedruns by announcing an event scheduled for July, providing them with information on how they can get involved.
- Virgile Blais joined the server, contributing to the sense of community and collaboration among its members.
- Corona_Chan proposed a novel approach using facial video data to predict ECG/PPG wave models, potentially helping others in their research or projects related to this topic by sharing relevant resources and ideas.

## Action Items
 Technical Tasks:
  - Form a team and join the server (mentioned by SSamuel, Andy Brock)
  - Keep up to date till contract ends and see where can help out after (yikesawjeez)

  - Apply framework for arc task with hilbert wave curves as inputs/outputs (Corona_Chan, Shaw)
  - Explore Transformers and RL reward function for solving tasks (Shaw)
- Documentation Needs: None explicitly requested.
- Feature Requests:
  - Apply a framework similar to the one in https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06483v1 for arc task with hilbert wave curves as inputs/outputs (Corona_Chan)
- Community Tasks:
  - Live hack sessions on weekends (Arch2230, goo14_)
