## Summary
 In the Discord chat, Yosef Frost inquired about tools for generating fake arc problems, leading to shaw recommending several GitHub repositories: michaelhodel/re-arc, frankaging/BabyARC, and neoneye/arc-dataset-collection. Subsequently, Yosef asked if submissions were public and how he could access mindsAI's current best 39% code. Meanwhile, JamieJoyce and happysmash27 joined the server, marking new community milestones.

## FAQ
 - What tool can generate fake arc problems?
  - Shaw: Michael Hodel's re-arc GitHub repository (https://github.com/michaelhodel/re-arc/) generates real ARC problems, while Frank Aging's BabyARC (https://github.com/frankaging/BabyARC) is another option for simpler problems.

- Are submissions public? Can I find mindsAI’s current best 39% code?
  - Shaw: Submissions are generally public, and you can explore various ARC datasets on Neoneye's GitHub repository (https://github.com/neoneye/arc-dataset-collection). However, finding the specific "best 39%" code for mindsAI might require further investigation or reaching out to the team directly.

## Who Helped Who
 - Shaw helped Yosef Frost with finding a tool for generating fake arc problems by providing GitHub links to various repositories.
- Shaw assisted Yosef Frost in locating resources related to arc datasets and possibly improving his own code performance, as indicated by sharing links to specific GitHub projects that could be relevant to his needs.
