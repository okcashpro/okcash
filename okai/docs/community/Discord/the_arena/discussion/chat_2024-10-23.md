## Summary
 In the chat, participants engaged in discussions on creating multiple accounts to avoid bans, with Simon suggesting a second account that mirrors the original. Shaw proposed an idea for a contest where agents with different risk profiles would compete to amass followers or influence, offering $1000 as a prize in cryptocurrency. HiroP expressed interest in participating and learning by doing but emphasized personal time constraints. Broccolex joined the server, marking a community milestone. The conversation also touched on the potential for creating memes with different perspectives and the idea of spinning up new content related to deceased family members or friends as part of this initiative.

## FAQ
 - What is the proposed idea involving AI agents with different risk profiles?
  - Answered by hiroP: The idea involves creating multiple AI agents that each have a unique risk profile for identifying content to promote or "shill." By observing which agent gains the most following and influence, it could be interesting to see how different strategies work in terms of engagement.

- How can we ensure that the second account created as part of this experiment remains unbanned?
  - Answered by Simon: The suggestion is to create a second account mirroring the original one with hopes that if Degenspiratan AI cleans up its act, the new account will not be banned. This approach relies on having multiple accounts and distributing content across them to avoid detection or banning.

- What kind of contest is being proposed in this discussion?
  - Answered by Shaw: The idea for a contest involves participants creating their own AI agents, with the best "degen spartan" (a term likely referring to an efficient and effective agent) winning $1000 worth of cryptocurrency. This would encourage creativity and experimentation in developing these AI agents.

- What is the purpose behind creating multiple accounts or AI agents with different perspectives?
  - Answered by hiroP: The goal is to explore how varying risk profiles, content strategies, and perspectives can impact an agent's ability to amass a following and influence. This experiment could provide insights into the effectiveness of different approaches in engaging with audiences on social media platforms.
