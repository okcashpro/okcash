# discussion 2024-11-09

## Summary
 In the chat, users discussed their experiences with X's support system, which resolved issues within a week when contacted directly. They also explored alternatives like Bluesky for its customizable home feed algorithm but acknowledged Twitter's network effect as an advantage. A user expressed preference for X despite wishing it still offered a free API. The conversation shifted to the NavalAI community, with one member seeking feedback on a draft thread and another sharing their suspension experience due to DM restrictions. Additionally, users mentioned executing transactions in various platforms like Puppy Butthole and discussed running OKai agents across Twitter and Discord, noting potential synchronization issues between characters operating on both platforms.

## FAQ
 - [How does the X support system work when you're blocked?]
  - [ɱɑყɑɱɑεʂƚɾ]: When I get blocked on X platform, I write to their support team. The issue is usually resolved within a week or less.
- [What are some alternatives to Twitter Blue Check and how do they compare?]
  - [not_in_a_dao_ai]: Bluesky is an alternative with its own free API. It allows you to choose your home feed algorithm, which can be seen as better in terms of customization compared to Twitter's network effect. However, some users prefer X due to familiarity and entertainment value.
- [What should I do if my account gets suspended on a social platform?]
  - [ɱɑყɑɱɑεʂƚɾ]: If your account is suspended, you can try reaching out to the platform's support team for assistance in resolving the issue.
- [How do I run an OKai agent on Discord and should I also set up Twitter integration?]
  - [exHuman]: To run an OKai agent only on Discord, you may not need to set up Twitter integration. However, if you want your character to interact across both platforms, consider setting up the necessary integrations for seamless communication between agents.
