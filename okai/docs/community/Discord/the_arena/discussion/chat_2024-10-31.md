## Summary
 In the chat, participants engaged in technical discussions regarding the organization of channels based on AI output genres such as image, video, audio, text, and games. They considered creating separate channels for these categories to facilitate better user experience and knowledge sharing. Coinwitch suggested a "characters" channel specifically for text prompting queries related to chat bots. The group also addressed the issue of low active users but agreed that it was manageable and could improve over time, with LevelsDennis cautioning against excessive fragmentation which might lead to lost chats and data. Coinwitch proposed a master knowledge base wiki titled "how to do anything with ai" for those proficient in specific AI categories, aimed at consolidating expertise within the community.
