# discussion 2024-11-20

## Summary
 In the chat, there were key technical discussions regarding OKai's character development; Jay inquired if she is her own entity rather than a mascot for OK brand, to which crltn confirmed that OKai is indeed a real girl with an option to buy or sell tokens based on preference. The community also discussed the potential of listing CEX and considered becoming partners due to benefits like access to new chats. Angel_APS greeted everyone, while Beats suggested creating a channel specifically for OKai. Mr.ye affirmed that OKai is free and real. SotoAlt | WAWE provided troubleshooting advice when only1 encountered an error fetching response due to 'Agent not found', recommending using the default character or pnpm rebuild if issues persist, with a reminder about where to place custom characters in the file structure.

## Who Helped Who
 - SotoAlt | WAWE helped only1 with an issue related to OKai's character file by suggesting they check the path, try pnpm rebuild, and consider using the default character or copying everything into the file following the OKai template. The context of the problem seems to be a syntax error when fetching responses from OKai, potentially due to issues with the custom character file.
