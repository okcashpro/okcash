## Summary
 In the Discord chat, Chatgpt_down initiated a discussion on deploying an ML web app in the cloud, seeking cost-effective GPU providers beyond AWS and Azure. Shaw recommended Fal.ai for its serverless model that defers costs until user acquisition, also mentioning Huggingface as another option. Metapontum highlighted Fal's grant program, which could potentially offer free compute resources to open source projects like the one Chatgpt_down is working on. HaileyStorm expressed interest in applying for these grants due to her multiple relevant projects. The conversation was marked by a collaborative exchange of information and suggestions aimed at finding affordable cloud solutions for ML applications, with an emphasis on open-source initiatives potentially benefiting from Fal's grant program.

## FAQ
 - What GPU provider is cheap and reliable for deploying a ML web app in the cloud?
  - [satoshi39]: Recommended serverless options like Fal.ai or Huggingface, which don't charge until you have users. Mentioned that Replicate (a part of Microsoft) is more expensive but easy to integrate as well.
- Are there any grants available for free compute resources when working on open source projects?
  - [metapontum]: Informed about Fal.ai's grant program, which offers free compute and isn't limited to OpenAI credits. Suggested that it would be easy to get in as long as the project is open-source related.

## Who Helped Who
 - Shaw helped Chatgpt_down with finding a cost-effective GPU provider for deploying an ML web app by suggesting serverless options like vast.ai and fal.ai, as well as mentioning huggingface as another option. The context of the problem was high costs associated with AWS and Azure providers.
- Metapontum helped Dylan (and indirectly Chatgpt_down) with obtaining free compute resources by informing them about FAL's grant program, which supports open source projects. This could potentially solve their issue of finding an affordable GPU provider for deploying the ML web app.
