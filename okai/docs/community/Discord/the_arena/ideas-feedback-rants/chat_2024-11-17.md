## Summary
 In the Discord chat, participants proposed various ideas to engage sports fans in web3 through a bot that interacts with professional athletes on Twitter, aiming for virality and mainstream attention. A security AI agent was suggested to scan links for potential threats amidst an influx of newcomers. Questions arose about the legitimacy of $okai token and whether certain technologies were launched by original teams or not. The community discussed innovative projects like AikoTV, while also emphasizing the need for a Dev wallet scanner to prevent rug pulls in the crypto space.
