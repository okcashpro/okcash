## Summary
 In the Discord chat, participants explored launching an agent on Vvaifun with a focus on donating tokens to vitaDAO for longevity research, discussing tokenomics and DAO involvement. The SciFoSX team introduced their AI-driven project SFX designed to autonomously conduct scientific research and develop blockchain technologies, inviting the community's guidance in its exploration. They launched on pump.fun but are not currently prioritizing token bonding or fundraising. Acidica shared her experience launching an agent with Vvaifun for learning purposes and mentioned a forthcoming project launch. Liamz expressed interest in implementing retweets for Twitter integration, made a PR related to it, and planned to develop a plugin enabling his agent to design and launch NFTs. The community also discussed connecting agents to Discord and the potential of creating official tokens or NFTs for projects like SciFoSX.

## FAQ
 - How can an Agent be launched on Vvaifun with part of the tokens bought going to a DAO like vitaDAO for longevity research?
  - UoS: To achieve this, you would need to set up tokenomics that allow for a portion of the tokens purchased by users to automatically go towards funding the DAO. This could involve creating specific smart contracts or mechanisms within Vvaifun's platform to facilitate such transactions.
- How can someone connect their Agent to Discord?
  - acidica: To connect an agent to Discord, you would need to use Discord bots and webhooks. You could create a bot that listens for specific commands or events within the Vvaifun platform and then interacts with your agent accordingly. Additionally, using webhooks can help automate certain actions based on triggers from both platforms.
- How do you make an NFT of an Agent?
  - liamz: To create an NFT for an agent, you would need to use a blockchain platform that supports non-fungible tokens (NFTs), such as Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain. You can then design and launch your own NFT using smart contract development tools like OpenZeppelin or Truffle Suite. Once the NFT is created, you can integrate it with your agent's functionality to allow for unique interactions and ownership experiences.
- How do I disable a Twitter bot from replying to old tweets?
  - liamz: To prevent a Twitter bot from replying to old tweets, you could modify the bot's code or settings to only respond to new mentions or direct messages. This may involve adjusting the search parameters used by your bot when scanning for relevant content on Twitter and ensuring that it filters out older tweets based on their timestamp.
- How can I get funding for my project without focusing on a coin?
  - tobi: While having an official token could help with fundraising, you can still attract investors by showcasing the potential of your project and its impact. Engage with relevant communities, such as #price-talk-trenches or other crypto forums, to share updates about your progress and seek support from interested parties who believe in your vision.

## Who Helped Who
