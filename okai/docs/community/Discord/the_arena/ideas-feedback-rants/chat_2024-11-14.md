## FAQ
 - What is the concept behind AI-powered agents in health insurance broker agencies?
  - ChrisBarnes1213: The idea is to partner with OK to create an AI general agent that can handle contract negotiations for small health insurance broker agencies. This would allow them to achieve hands-off, scalable revenue without traditional agents and focus on growth by reducing overhead and maximizing revenue retention.

- How could NFTs be integrated with AI agents?

- What are some potential applications of AI agents in various industries?
  - Dr. Neuro: One idea is to create an NFT collection where each NFT has its own unique AI agent with distinct personas and abilities, allowing for personalized experiences and interactions based on their trait combinations. This could be applied across multiple industries such as gaming, finance, or social media platforms.

- How can we involve the crowd in building new products/brands using AI agents?
