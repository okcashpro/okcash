## Summary
 In the discussion, Cyfer785 expressed frustration with purchasing high-value Twitter accounts and influencing engagement algorithms, while ATHðŸ¥­Hivo suggested following intuition. Yikesawjeez mentioned a puzzle/argument game they're playing that involves more lore, which aligns with Cyfer785's interest in creating an argument (arg) focused on thelema and oracularism rather than cryptography. Coinwitch reminisced about "ladder theory," indicating a shared understanding of its impact across genders. Yikesawjeez also noted missing the old tagline, which was retained but removed from the embed, emphasizing their preference for less cryptographic content and more enigmatic posts within the community.
