## Summary
 In the Discord chat, Dr. Neuro shared his vision for Nikolai Teslai, an AI agent project with three key features: a Launch Guide to help users launch their own AI agents, Instant Business Planning for creating business frameworks based on user input, and Live Experiments in the Lab where Nikolai will conduct experiments live. Dr. Neuro is working on making this project community-owned and scalable by collaborating with an old colleague who's a skilled developer to handle the technical build while he focuses on the business side.
