## Summary
 In the Discord chat, users discussed issues with DAO contracts not being recognized properly in the early stages of development. Flockaflame suggested that PMAIRCA competes on a trust leaderboard pitched by KOLs while Degensparta uses Twitter for trades; however, it's unclear if they will use the trust marketplace. Futjr mentioned that verified partners are required to generate a trust score and this feature would be extended after MVP testing is complete. Emzod d/acc raised concerns about agents understanding blockchain beyond narrow purpose trading. Rick shared a tweet from EHuanglu, indicating ongoing engagement with the community. Nona expressed interest in understanding the chain better, while Cyfer785 alerted users to voice cloning and advised using safe words or PGP for secure communication.
