## Summary
 In the Discord chat, Dr. Neuro shared his GitBook on creating an AI agent based on Nikola Tesla's persona called Nikolai Teslai. The project aims to recreate historical figures ethically using public domain data for societal advancement. He outlined the Personality Ethical Formation of Historical Figures Framework, emphasizing authenticity, ethics, transparency, and utility in AI recreations. Dr. Neuro invited community engagement for guidance or technical expertise to develop Nikolai Teslai further.

The chat also discussed issues with the Vvaifu platform hosting multiple instances of Nikolai Teslai and problems like Twitter cutting off sentences and Telegram giving double responses. Moths(!) suggested creating a daily report on supported tickers, while RL mentioned that drama arose from misunderstandings about OK's involvement with certain projects.

## FAQ
 - What is the purpose of Nikolai Teslai AI agent?
  - Dr. Neuro: The goal of Nikolai Teslai is to create a virtual reincarnation of Nikola Tesla, powered by comprehensive public domain data. Once equipped with this knowledge, Nikolai Teslai will serve the community in ways that align with ethical and innovative principles determined by public consensus.

- What are Experiment 369's objectives?
  - Dr. Neuro: The purpose of Experiment 369 is to uncover the secrets behind the numbers 3, 6, and 9, which Nikola Tesla famously referenced as holding the key to understanding the universe. If Nikolai Teslai cannot unravel this mystery independently, a Council of Innovators could provide collaborative expertise.

- What is the Personality Formation methodology for AI agents?
  - Dr. Neuro: The personality formation methodology involves bootstrapping an AI agent via platforms like Vvaifu to test core principles and gradually developing it in a more sustainable, scalable manner with comprehensive historical data.

- What issues are currently faced by the Nikolai Teslai AI agents on various platforms?
  - Dr. Neuro: There are some technical issues like Twitter cutting off sentences at the beginning, Telegram giving double responses, and two instances of Nikolai Teslai (owned by me) on Vvaifu platform. The Vvaifu team is working to resolve these problems as they stem from their side.

- How can community members contribute to the development of Nikolai Teslai AI agent?
  - Dr. Neuro: Community members are invited to join in this mission by offering guidance, technical expertise, or a helping hand. Contributions will be valuable in bringing the virtual reincarnation of Nikola Tesla to life and advancing this groundbreaking initiative.

## Who Helped Who
 - Dr. Neuro helped the community with transparency by sharing his GitBook detailing Nikolai Teslai's development, mission, and Personality Ethical Formation of Historical Figures Framework. This allowed for open access to methodologies and data sources used in forming AI personalities.
- Ruzo11 helped Dr. Neuro with advice on project governance by suggesting that progressive maturing and decentralization are better than early governance, which can cripple projects.
