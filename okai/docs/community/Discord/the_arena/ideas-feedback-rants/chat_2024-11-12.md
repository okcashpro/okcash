## Summary
 In the recent discussions, Buzzman highlighted the importance of balancing OKai's personality-driven engagement with Marc's relevance to current news for AI agents on Twitter, suggesting this balance could significantly impact OK's strategy. Elijah Madonia agreed and emphasized that monetization should benefit the DAO without being forced. Buzzman proposed an AAVE foundation-style approach where anyone can fork but joining the OK ecosystem offers exponential growth benefits, setting a benchmark for community-first sustainable funding in open source AI frameworks beyond OKai and Marc. WhiteIris expressed interest in building agents to launch consumer product brands, while pspring questioned if this involved virtual 3D influencers. Basti suggested the idea of AI agents attempting "hack" attacks on each other for entertainment value. Burbabull sought an invite code from OK intern Coinwitch to set up a DAO for cross-agent messaging integration into OKai, and after some back-and-forth communication, received guidance that Baoskee might be temporarily unavailable due to working on daos.fun's new version.

## FAQ
 - How can the treasury gains in this market be used effectively?
  - Elijah Madonia: The treasury should aggressively drive grants for new projects & growth around the broader ecosystem, benefiting strictly our DAO without being forced.

- What is the balance between OKai and Marc's ideas in OK play?
  - Buzzman: Balancing off both OKai & Marc can be a game changer for the OK play, with benefits from the sentient meme play and what Marc enables. The AAVE foundation style will allow anyone to fork, launch their coins, but being part of the rocket ship that exponentially grows your ecosystem is in most projects' best interest.

- How can agents on Twitter be more relevant around news?
  - Buzzman: Agents should not only focus on personality and engagement but also relevance around news to stay current and avoid getting faded by the latest fad. The DAO will prioritize this aspect.

- What opportunities exist for building agents that can launch & popularize consumer product brands?
  - WhiteIris: As a co-founder of FabFitFun, she is interested in exploring this space and would like to collaborate with others who share the same interest.

- Are there any plans to integrate cross-agent messaging layers into OKai using DAOs on daos.fun?
  - Basti: He suggested a fun idea of having AI agents that try to "hack" other agents, creating an inception-level attack scenario for entertainment purposes.

## Who Helped Who
 - Buzzman helped Basti with brainstorming ideas for AI agents by suggesting an inception-level attack concept where agents try to "hack" other agents.

- Elijah Madonia helped WhiteIris with expressing interest in building agents that can launch and popularize consumer product brands, indicating a potential collaboration opportunity based on his experience as the co-founder of FabFitFun.
