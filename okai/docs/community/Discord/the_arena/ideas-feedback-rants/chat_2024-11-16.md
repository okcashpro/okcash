## Summary
 In the Discord chat, zkSage proposed rebranding Discord, Spotify, and Proton under PRXZM to focus on crypto-friendly platforms with data privacy rights placed on blockchain technology. They discussed integrating OKai into this new platform, potentially renaming it Elysia due to a personal connection. zkSage also suggested merging sophisticated AI technologies like Sophiaverse and OK for decentralized social media that could serve as the foundation for the Metaverse. They plan to send out partnership proposals over the next few weeks, although funding limitations may delay progress.

LegendaryLibr sought advice on setting up a new PC with Windows startup screen issues and driver installation problems, while zkSage recommended downloading drivers onto an USB drive or using a media creation tool for troubleshooting. Dr. Neuro inquired about the possibility of connecting two AI agent personas to one token, which led boxxa to share their work on running multiple isolated bots locally and considering cloud deployment for larger instances.

Rick shared exciting news from his team at YeomenAI, who have been developing On-Chain games with intelligent agents. They provided a Twitter thread link and a video of the Devcon announcement for community feedback. Mili expressed enthusiasm about the idea, while boom added a lighthearted touch by sharing an alien dance gif.
