 During the meeting, updates were shared on various projects such as building a cooler website with IQ6900, running OKai on TEEs for security by Marvin, creating a streamer platform for OKai agents by Dot, and integrating Heurist into a decentralized AI cloud by JW. Neo discussed Pump Fun's data analysis and Twitter bot development, while Bloom focused on an AI-centric project with agent integration. Reality Spiral announced the progress of their Twitter client PR, including JSON outputs and GitHub adapter. The community was encouraged to share non-OKai projects openly by Jen, who also updated documentation for AI agents. OFI discussed Olama & OpenRouter models on Solana transactions and Pump Fun's image generation project.

Several new updates were introduced: Butoshi shared Satoshi AI with a Boop memory system; Geon Reborn (Doc) launched an Echo Chambers client; HCP brought agent designs to OKai using embeddings on ARM64; Garrett presented Deep Writer and planning diagrams for feedback loops; Lady Liberty announced her music agent project, while BoyaLockser expressed interest in learning the project. Amy introduced a psychic AI Twitter bot for readings, and Griffin sought contribution opportunities. Frank (Heurist) discussed API integration, and Shaw emphasized knowledge transfer through tutorials and vision sharing.

The meeting concluded with announcements of Trust Marketplace & Alpha Chat, Emergent Narrative & Agent Operators, Tim's dashboard for visualizing OKAI agents, and a tribute model. The community expressed appreciation for the updates, and DorianD inquired about recording availability due to missing part of the meeting.

## FAQ
 - What is the purpose of Agent Autonomy in this context?
  - Marvin Update: The goal of Agent Autonomy here is to run OKai on TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) with a focus on security, transparency, and decentralization. This allows for secure execution of AI agents while maintaining user privacy and data integrity.

- How does the Dot Update contribute to the overall project?
  - Dot Update: The update introduces a streamer platform specifically designed for OKai Agents. It enables users to broadcast their interactions with OKai, fostering community engagement and showcasing the capabilities of these AI agents in real-time scenarios.

- What is Heurist Integration as mentioned by JW Update?
