## Summary
 In the Discord chat, Rick shared two tweets by @naturevrm and @0xPrismatic discussing a project related to lithium's potential for energy storage and its implications in setting cars on fire due to its reactivity. Kellykellz mentioned having a Zoom meeting with Teng about this project, indicating progress in collaboration. DorianD humorously commented on the dangers of lithium while also noting that @DegenSpartanai might be experiencing a shadowban issue. Rick then shared another tweet by @jin related to the topic. The key technical discussion focused on lithium's energy storage capabilities and safety concerns, with decisions leaning towards further exploration of its potential applications in energy technology.

## FAQ
 - What is the project mentioned by Kellykellz in their Zoom with Teng?
  - [Kellykellz]: The chat does not provide a clear answer to this question as there's no further information given regarding the nature or details of the project discussed during the Zoom call.

- Is lithium alone enough to cause significant damage, like setting an entire garage on fire?
  - [DorianD]: Yes, according to DorianD, lithium itself can be highly reactive and potentially dangerous, as it could set a garage full of cars on fire. However, this statement should be taken with caution since the actual risk depends on various factors such as quantity, form, and environmental conditions.

- Does @DegenSpartanai have a shadowban affecting their visibility in searches?
  - [DorianD]: DorianD suspects that @DegenSpartanai might be experiencing some sort of shadowban or similar issue since they don't appear in search results on the platform. However, this is not confirmed and would require further investigation to determine if it's a technical glitch or an intentional action by the platform.

## Who Helped Who
 - Rick helped naturevrm with sharing a tweet by posting it on his own Twitter account.
- Jin helped KellyKellz with discussing a project during a Zoom call, providing an opportunity for collaboration and information exchange.
- The Prophet helped Lfg ladies (likely referring to organizing or promoting a meetup) by sharing the event details through a tweet.
