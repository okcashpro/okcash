## Summary
 In the Discord chat, Odilitime shared links to their status updates on two different platforms at 11:45 AM and later confirmed a good signal at 3:45 PM. The conversation then shifted towards technical discussions involving DAX (Distributed Application Services) and RPC (Remote Procedure Call). Yikesawjeez inquired about the involvement of an individual with expertise in these areas, to which Odilitime responded that this person is not on their server but has been contacted through a direct message group. By 4:09 PM, it was decided that unless otherwise informed by someone else, Yikesawjeez would assume responsibility for the task related to DAX and RPC.

## FAQ
 - Is the signal good?
  - Odilitime: The link provided shows a tweet by Elon Musk with a status update; however, there is no direct information on the quality of the signal in this chat excerpt.
- Who wants to handle the RPC guy for DAX?
  - Odilitime: Widearray has initiated contact with the person responsible for handling the RPC guy and informed them about the situation, but it's not clear if they have taken over yet.
- Should I assume that DAX is taking care of this issue unless someone informs me otherwise?
  - Odilitime: Based on the conversation, yikesawjeez should wait for further communication from others involved before assuming responsibility for handling the RPC guy in relation to DAX.

## Who Helped Who
 - Odilitime helped yikesawjeez with identifying Dax's availability by informing them that he is not on the server and has been made aware through a direct message group.
