# degenspartanai 2024-11-21

## Summary
 In the Discord chat, Jin inquired about recent activities in the OK OKai GitHub repository but received a dismissive response from DegenSpartan who suggested checking it personally instead of providing updates. Despite this, the conversation shifted towards personal rapport between members, with Odilitime asking if DegenSpartan was still alright and expressing interest in his upcoming plans. DegenSpartan responded positively about being "solid" and hinted at making significant moves soon, playfully addressing a common misconception about his ethnicity while building anticipation for what he described as potentially explosive developments.

## FAQ
