## FAQ
 - What is the current market sentiment among chat participants?
  - Basedfhoul: The sentiment appears bullish with excitement over new buyers entering the market at a higher price point ($49k), indicating strong interest in reaching $1B valuation, which would be a significant increase from the current value. There's also mention of "thin liquidity" and anticipation for future events like Valhalla.

- Who is cobie, and why are they mentioned?
  - Basedfhoul: Cobie was brought up in the chat as someone who might have been involved in a significant transaction or event related to the market being discussed (possibly an "ape" referring to a large purchase). However, there's skepticism about their involvement.

- What is the general attitude towards short-term price action?
  - Zoo: The chat indicates that some participants are not overly concerned with short-term price fluctuations and instead focus on long-term accumulation strategies. This suggests a more patient approach to investment among certain members of the group.
