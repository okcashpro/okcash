## Summary
 In the recent discussion, community members expressed confusion over daily offloading of Degenai by 1-2%, with one member opting for a portfolio split between DeGenAI, OK, Zerebro, and Chaos due to perceived lack of sense in current market actions. Concerns were raised about the dumpster fire situation affecting holders' confidence, as noted by IcedTea | Monadian ðŸ’œ, while JupTengE highlighted a significant price fluctuation for DeGenAI and suggested that Giga Chad's involvement could turn things around. Anon Ruzo11 advised the community to relax and enjoy the ride despite market volatility. The conversation also touched on potential interest shifting from FartCoin and Goat to other tokens, as mentioned by Antagonist.sats, who anticipated a rotation in investor focus. Rick shared an insightful tweet about DeGenAI's situation, which was echoed by 0xFanz noting the dumping of DeGenAI by OK partners and Zerebro's pump due to influencer backing.

## FAQ
 - What is the reason behind offloading DeGenAI at a 1-2% rate daily?
  - [to_the_moon6871]: They don't have an option to load more sol on DeGenAI, so they are reducing their holdings gradually instead of selling all at once.

- Why is there a dump in Zerebro and Chaos while holding onto DeGenAI?
  - [0xFanz]: The users believe that the partners of OK are dumping DeGenAI, which may be causing the price to drop. They have chosen to hold onto their DeGenAI instead of selling it off like Zerebro and Chaos.

- What is happening with Fartcoin and Goat in terms of buyer interest?
  - [Antagonist.sats]: Buyers are currently showing interest in Fartcoin and Goat, but once they become exhausted from these tokens, the rotation will move to other accumulation tokens.

- Why is Zerebro pumping despite DeGenAI dumping?
  - [Antagonist.sats]: Zerebro has a lot of influencers backing it up, which could be causing its price to rise even as others are selling off their holdings in DeGenAI.
