## Summary
 In the community chat, members engaged in discussions regarding the need for an advertising team to promote their Telegram channel alongside a raid telegram feature. A developer shared insights into ongoing projects that included art contributions from 7OROY and aimed at creating a long-term product vision. André mentioned OK's chart, while ZO hinted at an upcoming launch and encouraged the community to consider starting their own venture if it wasn't a "rug." The conversation shifted towards cryptocurrency when Rick shared a link to CODEX/SOL pump on PUMP.fun, which was followed by discussions about market reactions and strategies for investing in Codex while it remained in the accumulation zone. Noname $OK advised buying during dips, with Dr adding that some dips could be seen as blessings from heaven.
