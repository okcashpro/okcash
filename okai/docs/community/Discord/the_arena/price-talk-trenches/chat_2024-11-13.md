## Summary
 In the chat, Zodiac announced that Spencer is running a venture capital fund, which André agreed with but sought clarification on whether it was specifically a VC fund. The conversation then shifted to discussing various AI projects, including Lumina AI, which had recently reached 200 million in value and Elon Musk's interactions with Naval Ravikant, the inspiration behind an AI named Naval. There were also mentions of a significant increase in investment for another project during the NFT bear phase, attributed to Zodiac.
