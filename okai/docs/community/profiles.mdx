# GitHub Contributors

This is a quick and dirty implementation of profiles that are programmatically generated from github data from `okcashpro/okai` repo. I'm looking for some help to integrate into Docusaurus as react components. See the code for generating profiles here: https://github.com/okcashpro/okcashpro.github.io

    width: '100%',
    height: '100vh',
    border: 'none',
  }}
/>
