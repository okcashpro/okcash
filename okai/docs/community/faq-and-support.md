### Is okcashpro affiliated with a16z?
No, okcashpro is not affiliated with the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). The name is a playful reference and parody. There is no affiliation with a16z.

### What is the OKai framework?
The OKai framework is an open-source platform that allows developers to create and deploy their own AI agents. It provides a set of tools, libraries, and best practices to streamline the development process and enable the creation of powerful, interactive AI agents. The agents based on the OKai framework can interact on Twitter and Discord, with Discord voice support, read links / PDFs / summarize conversations, and interact with the blockchain.

### How does daos.fun work?
1. **Fundraise**: Creators have 1 week to fundraise the desired SOL amount. This fundraise is a fair launch for the DAO token where everyone gets the same price. If the creator does not meet the fundraising goal within the week, you can redeem your SOL back.
2. **Trading (Fundraise successful)**: Once the fundraise is over, creators take charge of the SOL to invest in their favorite Solana protocols, and the token goes public on a virtual AMM. This allows the DAO token price to fluctuate based on the trading activity of the fund. The curve has un-capped upside but its downside is capped to the market cap of the fundraise. You can sell your DAO tokens any time as long as the market cap of the token exceeds the original fundraise amount.
3. **Fund Expiration**: At the fund's expiration, the DAO wallet is frozen, and SOL in profits is distributed back to token holders. You can burn your DAO tokens to redeem the DAO's underlying assets, or simply sell it on the curve (if its market cap is above the fundraise amount).

### What is an investment DAO?
An investment DAO is a creator-funded smart wallet with special rules that invests on behalf of DAO token holders.

### What are verified creators on daos.fun?
Creators that daos.fun extensively verifies will have a blue checkmark next to them. Any creator without a checkmark you will have to trust at your own risk. DYOR (Do Your Own Research).

### What Happens When Fund Expires?

Fund closing does NOT halt trading. Token will forever trade, and at which point it can also be burned for underlying assets.

### Why Dexscreener Show DAO tokens are mintable?

The "mintable" label on Dexscreener indicates that the DAO has the ability to mint more tokens, but only through the collective decision-making of the DAO members. No single person can unilaterally mint more tokens. The voting module for daos.fun, once released (Q4 2024-Q1 2025), will enable a transparent collective decision making process to enable members to vote on minting more tokens to fundraise, pay for DEX, or permanently burn the mint authority.

### Staking and Rewards

daos.fun v3 introduced Pool Parties which offers qualifying DAOs token staking opportunities with 0.5% fees on transactions. The 0.5% fees are auto-compounded into SOL and okcashpro (UniswapV2 model). okcashproPOOL LP value volatility is due to token price changes. Fee calculator is coming soon.

## okcashpro Marc

### What are okcashpro's investment areas?

### How does AI Marc make decisions?
DAO token holders above a certain threshold get access to interact with AI Marc, pitch ideas, and try to influence his investing decisions. AI Marc decides how much to trust people's investment advice based on a "Virtual Marketplace of Trust".

### When does AI Marc Start Tading

First phase where we implement and test functionality is in progress. Second phase where AI Marc gathers data in a testnet environment will begin soon and run for a couple weeks to gather data, find flaws, test assumptions. Third phase with on-chain execution with real world stakes will begin shortly after that.
