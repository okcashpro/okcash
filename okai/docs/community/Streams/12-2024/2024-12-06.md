## Summary

This is the third part of the live stream series "AI Agent Dev School" hosted by Shaw from OK, focusing on building AI agents using the OKai framework.

**Individual Updates** - Many contributors gave updates on their work, including new plugins (like a plugin for emotional responses and Coinbase integration), infrastructure improvements (like GitHub integration, a testing framework, and a unified messaging bus), applications (like a validator run by an AI agent, Reddit and Slack integration, text/video to video projects, uncensored AI agents, and a Solana wallet prototype), and community projects (like an AI-generated PFP collection). Many of the updates focused on shipping and getting things done, rather than future plans.

* **Updating OKai:** Shaw emphasizes staying up-to-date with the rapidly evolving OKai project due to frequent bug fixes and new features. He provides instructions on pulling the latest changes from the main branch on GitHub.
* **Focus on Providers and Evaluators:** The stream focuses on building a practical provider-evaluator loop to demonstrate a popular use case for AI agents – filling out a form by extracting user information.
* **Form Builder Example:** Shaw walks the audience through building a "form provider" that gathers a user's name, location, and job. This provider utilizes a cache to store already extracted information and instructs the agent to prompt the user for any missing details.
* **Evaluator Role:** The evaluator continually checks the cache for the completeness of user data. Once all information is extracted, the evaluator triggers an action to send the collected data to an external API (simulated in the example).
* **Live Coding and AI Assistance:** Shaw live codes the example, using tools like "Code2Prompt" and Claude AI to help generate and refine the code. He advocates for writing code in a human-readable manner, utilizing comments to provide context and guidance for both developers and AI assistants.
* **Agentic Applications:**  Shaw highlights the potential of agentic applications to replicate existing website functionality through conversational interfaces, bringing services directly to users within their preferred social media platforms.
* **Community Engagement:**  Shaw encourages active participation from the community, suggesting contributions to the project through pull requests and feedback on desired features and patterns for future Dev School sessions.

**Overall, this live stream provided a practical tutorial on building a common AI agent use case (form filling) while emphasizing the potential of the OKai framework for developing a wide range of agentic applications.**

## Hot Takes

1. **"But they're really fucking cool. Really, really, really cool stuff...you're going to have to see it on the timeline when it drops." (00:03:43)** - Shaw teases secret projects with strong conviction, building anticipation and hype, but offering zero specifics. This generates buzz but can also frustrate listeners wanting concrete info.

2. **"The whole server is kind of set up where...this project can start to feel more like a video game in a way. And we have these interfaces and AI agents that are playing all sorts of different roles throughout." (00:08:05)** -  Jin envisions the project evolving into a gamified experience. This could be a controversial approach to open-source development, as it might prioritize gamification over core functionality or alienate some contributors.

3. **"if we're really going to go to AGI we got to have some kind of Ubi component in there." (00:14:44)** - Reality Spiral casually connects AGI development with Universal Basic Income, a potentially contentious socio-economic topic that intertwines technological advancement with wealth distribution.

4. **"I've been screaming out of my lungs for grok 3 to come out and uh y'all are slow Developers." (01:47:12)** - Roberto jokingly (or perhaps not) criticizes the development speed of Grok, creating a moment of tension and sparking debate about the pace of AI development in general (especially relative to open-source community projects).

5. **"agents are going to replace the application layer...I am the fucking website" (02:12:11 & 02:12:58)** - Shaw's bold prediction about the future of the internet and applications, positioning agents not just as tools but as the very foundation of online interaction. This radical vision is sure to stir debate about the future of web development and user experience.
