## Summary

AI Agent Dev School Part 2, Electric Boogaloo

The session focuses on building complex AI agents, with Shaw diving into core abstractions: plugins, providers, actions, and evaluators.

Actions are defined as capabilities that agents can execute, ranging from simple tasks to complex workflows. Providers serve as information sources for agents, similar to context providers in React. Evaluators run after actions, enabling agents to reflect on their state and decisions.

The live coding portion demonstrates creating a "DevSchool" plugin from scratch, starting with a simple "Hello World" action and progressing to a more complex "Current News" action that fetches and formats news articles. Shaw shows how to extract data from conversations using prompts, making actions dynamic.

The session covers memory management, explaining how agents store and recall information through different types of memory:
- Knowledge: Information retrievable through search
- Lore: Random facts that add variety to responses
- Conversation history: Recent interactions and context

Shaw emphasizes the importance of prompt engineering, demonstrating how the structure and order of information significantly impacts agent responses. He shows how to view agent context through console logs to understand model inputs and improve agent behavior.

The session concludes with discussions about knowledge management, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and future developments in AI agent capabilities, including the possibility of dynamically generating character files.

## Hot Takes

1. **OpenAI models are "dumb" due to RLHF and "wokeness" (02:03:00-02:04:07)**
> "But basically, I've also made them sort of useless by RLHFing. Like, very basic capability, like a haystack test out of them. ... I'm against killing the capability and making models way worse than they are for someone's political agenda. I just don't think that's the world we want to live in."

Shaw here expresses frustration with OpenAI's approach to alignment, arguing that RLHF has diminished the capabilities of their models and that this is due to a "woke" agenda. This take is controversial because it attributes technical limitations to political motivations and ignores the complexities of aligning powerful AI systems.

2. **OpenAI models shouldn't be "telling" developers what they can and can't do (02:03:29-02:03:50)**
> "OpenAI, if you're listening, please fucking stop telling me how to run models. You don't know as well as I do. I do this every day. You're a fucking engineer who has to go train, like, an LLM. I actually have to use the LLM."

This rant criticizes OpenAI's models for "telling" developers what they can and can't do, arguing that the models are not as knowledgeable as the developers who are actually using them. This take could be seen as dismissive of the role of AI systems in providing helpful feedback and limitations.

3. **Prompt engineering is the "most easy improvement" for AI agents (02:06:09-02:06:27)**
> "Huge amount of research would go into that... That's where we'll see like the most easy improvement in our agents."

Shaw argues that prompt engineering holds the key to significant improvements in AI agents, stating that it's the "most easy improvement." This take is controversial because it downplays the importance of other areas like model architecture, training data, and algorithm development.

4. **Character files could be generated at runtime, making existing character files obsolete (02:22:05-02:22:53)**
> "The entire character file could be generated at runtime... The agent's like, I have no idea who I am. And you're like, oh, your name is OKai, and you like berries. OK, cool. I guess I like berries."

This take suggests that character files could be generated at runtime, rendering current character files obsolete. This idea is controversial because it could lead to a more dynamic and unpredictable agent behavior, which could raise concerns about control and reliability.

5. **A "badge" system will reward developers who create custom actions, evaluators, and providers (02:24:45-02:25:49)**
> "If you want that badge, what I'd like you to do is come to the AI Agent Dev School, make an action, have your agent do something. Those are the kinds of people that I really think we'll want to, you know, keep in our ecosystem and keep busy."

This take suggests a "badge" system to recognize developers who go beyond the basics and create custom components for AI agents. This could be seen as elitist or exclusionary, potentially creating a hierarchy within the AI agent development community.
