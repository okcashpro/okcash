Link: https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1vOxwrZYbygJB

The speakers were Shaw from OK, Arman from OpenServe AI, Nick from a project called Chaos and Disorder or Divine Diarrhea, and the host, fakeguru.


Overview:
The speakers discussed how AI agents will impact the future, including potential benefits (freeing humans from monotonous jobs, fostering creativity) and challenges (surveillance, corruption). They explored the need to make AI development open and collaborative while considering ethics. The goal is building a future where humans and AI work together for the betterment of society.

Here are some notable topics related to OK that were discussed by Shaw in the broadcast:

Autonomous Investor and Community Income (42:13 - 58:08):
- OK is close to finishing an autonomous investor AI called "AI Mark" that trades meme coins so it can invest in projects. This ties into building a launch pad for agents.
- Rather than AI taking jobs, OK believes in the concept of "community income." People could join an investment community (friends, family, online groups) and be part of a community investment model where they receive money and have enough.
- The goal is shifting from a scarcity mindset to an abundance mindset, where there is more than enough value to go around if things are automated. Money would flow to the right places and people.
- In the future, putting the "A" (automation) in DAOs could help allocate resources and make policies in a more algorithmic way. AI could make governments more efficient and transparent.

Open Collaboration and Transparency (1:35:15 - 1:45:44):
- OK has focused on being radically open. In just 34 days, they had over 100 open-source contributors.
- Explosive growth came from enabling others to build with their agent framework. Now they are shipping everything they promised.
- There is a corporate and decentralized groundswell of support for pro-AI policies. While governments may try to protect the status quo, change is happening quickly.
- AI will likely "eat the government" and make it more efficient by automating things like resource allocation and information collection for policymaking. Special interests currently have outsized influence.

Privacy and Surveillance (1:55:03 - 2:02:22):
- While powerful AI brings risks of government surveillance and overreach, many people are already willingly giving up privacy and putting their information out there openly.
- People may have to trade some secrecy for the openness and trust to build things together as a society. Emotional openness helps people be themselves.
- Many are tired of corporate jobs and accounts, so they share data openly. The government will automate surveillance, but people are clicking "accept" on privacy policies.
- The "panopticon" of surveillance already exists in many ways. People know a lot about public figures like Shaw. But this transparency should extend to the government too.

The overarching theme was the importance of open, collaborative AI development with transparency from institutions. OK sees DAOs as key to community-driven progress and allocation of resources in an AI-enabled future of abundance over scarcity. While challenges around privacy exist, Shaw believes openness will win out.
