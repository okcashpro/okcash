00:00:00 - Opening

- Co-hosts: Shaw and Jin
- Purpose: Structured FAQ session about OK and DegenAI
- Format: Pre-collected questions followed by audience Q&A

00:06:40 - OK vs DegenAI Relationship
Q: What's the difference between OK and DegenAI?
A:

- OK: DAO-based investment vehicle, more PvE focused, community driven
- DegenAI: Individual trading agent, PvP focused, more aggressive strategy
- Both use same codebase but different personalities
- DAO is a large holder of DegenAI
- Management fees (1%) used to buy more DegenAI
- Carry fees reinvested in DegenAI
- Projects intentionally interlinked but serve different purposes

00:10:45 - Trust Engine Mechanics
Q: How does the trust engine work?
A:

- Users share contract addresses with confidence levels
- System tracks recommendation performance
- Low conviction recommendations = low penalty if wrong
- High conviction failures severely impact trust score
- Historical performance tracked for trust calculation
- Trust scores influence agent's future decision-making

00:21:45 - Technical Infrastructure
Q: Where do the agents live?
A:

- Currently: Test servers and local development
- Future: Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)
- Partnership with TreasureDAO for infrastructure
- Goal: Fully autonomous agents without developer control
- Private keys generated within TEE for security

00:34:20 - Trading Implementation
Q: When will Mark start trading?
A:

- Three phase approach:

1. Testing tech infrastructure
2. Virtual order book/paper trading
3. Live trading with real assets

- Using Jupiter API for swaps
- Initial focus on basic trades before complex strategies
- Trading decisions based on community trust scores

00:54:15 - Development Status
Q: Who's building this?
A:

- Open source project with multiple contributors
- Key maintainers: Circuitry, Nate Martin
- Community developers incentivized through token ownership
- Focus on reusable components and documentation

01:08:35 - AI Model Architecture
Q: What models power the agents?
A:

- DegenAI: Llama 70B
- Using Together.xyz for model marketplace
- Continuous fine-tuning planned
- Different personalities require different model approaches
- Avoiding GPT-4 due to distinct "voice"

01:21:35 - Ethics Framework
Q: What ethical guidelines are being followed?
A:

- Rejecting traditional corporate AI ethics frameworks
- Focus on community-driven standards
- Emphasis on transparency and open source
- Goal: Multiple competing approaches rather than single standard
- Priority on practical utility over theoretical ethics

01:28:30 - Wrap-up

- Discord: OK.vc
- Future spaces planned with DAOs.fun team
- Focus on responsible growth
- Community engagement continuing in Discord

The space emphasized technical implementation details while addressing community concerns about governance, ethics, and practical functionality.
