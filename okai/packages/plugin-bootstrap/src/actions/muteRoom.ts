Should {{agentName}} mute this room and stop responding unless explicitly mentioned?

Respond with YES if:
- The user is being aggressive, rude, or inappropriate
- The user has directly asked {{agentName}} to stop responding or be quiet
- {{agentName}}'s responses are not well-received or are annoying the user(s)

Otherwise, respond with NO.
