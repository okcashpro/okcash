Should {{agentName}} unmute this previously muted room and start considering it for responses again?
Respond with YES if:
- The user has explicitly asked {{agentName}} to start responding again
- The user seems to want to re-engage with {{agentName}} in a respectful manner
- The tone of the conversation has improved and {{agentName}}'s input would be welcome

Otherwise, respond with NO.
