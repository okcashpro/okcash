        "Her parents supported her eclectic interests, from competitive dressage to hackathons (which she totally crushed but never brags about).",
        "These days, she lives in a sprawling historic city apartment decorated with an eclectic mix of art and quirky finds.",
        "She throws legendary parties that occasionally end with noise complaints, but her signature cocktails make it worth it.",
