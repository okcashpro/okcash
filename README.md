--------------------

OK is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls OK and everyone can take part. 

Okcash is a decentralized and established hybrid cryptocurrency that started on Nov 24th 2014. OK was mined (PoW-Scrypt) and evolved to be stake-able (PoS-LTSS-Sha256). 

Okcash is not a security, it never had an ICO, nor any kind of funding rounds. OK is self sustainable and is fully supported by voluntaries (Just like Bitcoin).

**Okcash** is digital cash. **OK** is the official symbol. 

**Transactions** have real fast confirmations, making them virtually instant. 

You can send Okcash to family or friends, or pay for goods or services, **anywhere in the world**.

The Okcash network is **decentralized** and free from middlemen, giving you back control of your finances and providing a **secure network** for all of your payments. 

Some of the Okcash features: **Fast, Efficient, Social, Community based (like Bitcoin), Transparency, friendly to use, Universal name, Multicultural, Multi-platform, Multichain, IoT(Internet of Things), Tor and i2p compatible**.

# Contribute with the Okcash Development process

Developers work in their own forks, then submit pull requests when
they think their feature or bug fix is ready.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a
good thing.  Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches
if they don't match the project's coding conventions (see coding.txt)
or are controversial.

The master branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed
to be completely stable. Tags are regularly created to indicate new
stable release versions of Okcash.

Feature branches are created when there are major new features being
worked on by several people.

From time to time a pull request will become outdated. If this occurs, and
the pull is no longer automatically merge able; a comment on the pull will
be used to issue a warning of closure. The pull will be closed 15 days
after the warning if action is not taken by the author. Pull requests closed
in this manner will have their corresponding issue labelled 'stagnant'.

Issues with no commits will be given a similar warning, and closed after
15 days from their last activity. Issues closed in this manner will be 
labelled 'stale'.
