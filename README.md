# Contribute to the Okcash Development process

Developers collaborate by working in their own forks, pushing commits when they believe their enhancement or bug fix is complete.

Acceptance of contributions hinges on a consensus regarding the value they add to Okcash. Contributors should be prepared to refine and re-submit their work in line with the project's coding standards (refer to coding.txt) and to address any areas of contention.

The master branch undergoes regular builds and tests, offering a snapshot of the latest developments without an absolute guarantee of stability. Stable release versions of Okcash are marked by tags for clarity and reliability.

Instead of feature branches, our workflow relies on comprehensive collaboration directly through forks for significant new features, ensuring that all contributions are meticulously integrated.

Occasionally, a pull request may become outdated due to changes in the master that render it non-mergeable. In such cases, if no action is taken by the author within 15 days of this, the pull request will be closed.

Similarly, issues without any commits over time will receive a warning of impending closure. Without activity within 15 days of such a notice, the issue will be closed, ensuring the focus remains on active and relevant project tasks.
