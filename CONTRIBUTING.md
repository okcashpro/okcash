## The OODA Loop: A Framework for Contribution

We believe in the power of the OODA Loop - a decision-making framework that emphasizes speed and adaptability. OODA stands for:

-   **Observe**: Gather information and insights about the project, the community, and the broader AI ecosystem.
-   **Orient**: Analyze your observations to identify opportunities for contribution and improvement.
-   **Decide**: Choose a course of action based on your analysis. This could be proposing a new feature, fixing a bug, or creating content.
-   **Act**: Execute your decision and share your work with the community.

## How to Contribute
