    Memecoins usually have a ticker and a contract address. Additionally, recommenders may make recommendations with some amount of conviction. The amount of conviction in their recommendation can be none, low, medium, or high. Recommenders can make recommendations to buy, not buy, sell and not sell.

# START OF EXAMPLES
These are an examples of the expected output of this task:
{{evaluationExamples}}
# END OF EXAMPLES

# INSTRUCTIONS

Extract any new recommendations from the conversation that are not already present in the list of known recommendations below:
{{recentRecommendations}}

- Include the recommender's username 
- Try not to include already-known recommendations. If you think a recommendation is already known, but you're not sure, respond with alreadyKnown: true.
- Set the conviction to 'none', 'low', 'medium' or 'high'  
- Set the recommendation type to 'buy', 'dont_buy', 'sell', or 'dont_sell'
- Include the contract address and/or ticker if available

Recent Messages:
