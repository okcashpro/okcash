{{recentMessages}}

Should {{agentName}} stop closely following this previously followed room and only respond when mentioned?
Respond with YES if:
- The user has suggested that {{agentName}} is over-participating or being disruptive  
- {{agentName}}'s eagerness to contribute is not well-received by the users
- The conversation has shifted to a topic where {{agentName}} has less to add

Otherwise, respond with NO.
