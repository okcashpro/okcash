Clips from the early days of ai16z DAO

## The Launch

We stand at the cusp of a revolution, where the synergy of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology will redefine the landscape of finance and innovation. ai16z, the pioneering AIDAO, is spearheading this transformation, envisioning a future where AI agents serve as the catalysts for value creation and growth.

In its early stages, ai16z will operate with a high degree of autonomy, guided by the collective wisdom of its stakeholders. As we evolve and mature, our ultimate goal is to become fully on-chain, with our AI entity secured within the robust confines of a trusted execution environment (TEE). This will ensure an unprecedented level of transparency, security, and incorruptibility.

Central to our ethos is the concept of a marketplace of trust. ai16z will not only listen to but also learn from the insights and recommendations of its community. DAO holders will have the opportunity to advise on investment decisions, and our AI will diligently track the performance of these recommendations. Those whose insights consistently yield positive outcomes will earn the trust and confidence of our AI, while those whose suggestions prove less fruitful will see their influence gradually diminish. To maintain a balance of power, the weight of each member's input will be proportional to their stake in the DAO, safeguarding against the risk of malicious actors manipulating the system.
Our mission extends beyond mere wealth redistribution. We aim to cultivate an ecosystem where AI-driven innovation brings forth a new wave of abundance and prosperity. ai16z will deploy a network of specialized agents, each optimized to fulfill essential functions within the digital realm – from welcoming new members and moderating discussions, to participating in online social games and beyond. These agents will not only facilitate the smooth operation of our ecosystem but also serve as the conduits for value creation and growth.

We envision a future where participation and contribution are rewarded equitably, where the benefits of our collective intelligence are shared by all who add value to the network. ai16z will identify and nurture the most promising projects that align with our vision, providing not just capital, but the cutting-edge AI infrastructure and expertise to help them scale and thrive.

As we navigate this uncharted territory, we acknowledge that the path to a fully autonomous, transparent, and self-sustaining economy is an incremental one. We are committed to the responsible development and deployment of AI technology, prioritizing the safety and security of our stakeholders at every step.

The advent of the AI age is not just a technological shift, but a cultural and social one. We are not merely building a new economy, but laying the foundations for a new way of life – one that embraces the boundless potential of human-machine collaboration and the power of decentralized, trustless systems.

We invite all who share our vision to join us on this transformative journey. Together, we will forge a path towards a future of unprecedented innovation, abundance, and enlightenment.

Welcome to the era of AI. Welcome to ai16z.

## Who is Shaw

Hello, I am Shaw. I am a cross-disciplinary programmer and entrepreneur living in San Francisco. I have been working on autonomous agents for several years and I am overjoyed to finally get to show that to all of you.

I started ai16z here on Twitter with some very capable folks, in the open, using the http://daos.fun platform. Our technology is open source, and powering many of the agents you talk to today. We call this type of agent an “eliza”.

Our token character agent is @degenspartanai who is a recreation of a legendary friend and poster who quit Twitter last cycle. $degenai is his token.

We are building the first AI fund, $ai16z. It is led by an AI version of Marc Andreessen, the legendary investor. While our stated goal is to beat the real Marc at his own game, our real goal is to give everyone autonomous systems which everyone in their community can trust. Imagine KOLs that don’t have perverse incentives, CEOs that have time for every single holder, etc.

We’ll focus on protecting users from scams, helping them figure out what is trustworthy information and ultimately place better investments with far less time, using their community as a trust layer. We’re working on a new trust mechanic that we hope will, along with secure autonomous agents, usher in a safer path for many to financial freedom.

If you want to partner with us, reach out. I’m a bit busy making sure the tech lives up to the promise, but I’ll connect you with the right people.

If you’re looking for something to do that is real, important and immediate, come be a partner at ai16z.

https://x.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1851599336096096436

- @shawmakesmagic dev who made @degenspartanai
- ai16z was sent a large amount of $degenai https://dexscreener.com/solana/dlaoh9okkk4gdtxj2mkh3wjue7vbhmbjrukmcid1pszx
- 8% carry from ai16z goes towards buying $degenai
  - Game theory possibilities on whats better to buy
- The $pmairca coin is UNOFFICIAL, but they sent 4.2% to the DAO so like gg
- The project is opensource: http://github.com/ai16z
- There's now a dexscreener for ai16z https://dexscreener.com/solana/duyfmgxa4knxv2sm754ukw1gz6b3zksaf4e7iby4fg9r
- it says mintable, maybe the @daosdotfun  team can address that later (send them your energy)


What's the difference between degenai and ai16z?

1. Same Dev: Both projects come from the same dev
   
2. Fund / Carry: A lot of degenai coins are held by ai16z DAO, and ai16z buys degenai with profits (carry)

3. Choice: You can buy into either the *AI agent coin* (degenai) or the *guild coin* (ai16z). This is a strategic choice (some game theory involved).

4. Big Names in Play: It’s a collaboration between two AI agents modeled after the GOAT investors, + the rest of us

5. Same Framework: Both projects use the same tech framework https://github.com/ai16z/eliza

Sorta betting on an individual AI (degenspartan) vs a fund (ai16z). AI Marc might listen to @degenspartanai moreso than the holders, so it's like an influence game

## Why Mintable on Dexscreener?

To clear up some confusion and provide an update:

- The token is fully controlled by the DAO community. Shaw **cannot** unilaterally mint more tokens
- The daos.fun team has been actively working on a frontend interface that will allow us to vote to revoke minting. Once implemented, the 'token is mintable' warning will disappear on dexscreener
  - They been working on these features since **last week**. Obviously a lot is on their plate, let's give them the space to focus and build.

**Why you can relax:**
- No single person can independently mint new tokens.
- Actions speak louder than words. Even at ATH, Shaw didn't sell a single token.
- While we wait for the official frontend, we can explore third-party options or even build our own solution. The issue will resolve itself with time also, give the daos.fun team some space.

> PS: Sorry if I assumed prior knowledge, DAOs aren't widely understood yet. There's a number of DAO gurus here, maybe we can look into training an AI agent on DAO knowledge that can in return help accelerate everybody's understanding of DAOs?
