## Summary
 In the Discord chat, participants focused on technical discussions regarding AI-driven bot development for gif selection based on text prompts, with a mention of needing Visual Language Models (VLM). They also addressed website domain issues, confirming an update to ai16z.com and correcting it to dework.ai. The group discussed the potential integration of venture capital investments into their platform through smart contracts for on-chain projects, with a suggestion to create a PRD for UX around this feature. Additionally, they explored fair launch platforms like mint.it and considered streaming options to engage cryptonative communities.

## FAQ
 - Is this a bug or a feature?
  - DEMIAN | DAPPCRAFT | ai2^4z: It's wrong domain. Use https://ai16z.ai instead of the incorrect one provided in the chat.
- What is causing the site update issue and how can it be resolved?
  - kellykellis: The site needs an updated link to dework, which should resolve the issue.
- How can we ensure a return on investment for venture capital funding through smart contracts?
  - shaw: We need to programmatically guarantee a return and focus on fair launch ways where capital transfers remain on-chain or involve web3 projects with an on-chain component.
