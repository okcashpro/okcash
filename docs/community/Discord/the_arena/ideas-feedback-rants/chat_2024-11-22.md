## Summary
 In the Discord chat, Nona proposed an autonomous trading agent framework based on in-context learning; Gilles introduced his idea for a dark fantasy PVE game called "EclipseAI: Shadows of the Abyss," featuring procedurally generated dungeons and skill progression. LiveTheLifeTV expressed interest but noted their age might be a hindrance, while also mentioning financial concerns related to donations. RL raised a question about improving pin visibility for newcomers in specific channels. Hionei introduced themselves as an experienced blockchain and frontend developer with expertise in React, Next, Vue, software wallets, trading bots, backtesting systems, and NFT flipping bots. Reading Ape discussed the confusion around tokenomics and exposure to Eliza's ecosystem, suggesting that ai16z might be THE token for such exposure, with a focus on LP as a potential solution.

## FAQ

- What is the confusion regarding tokenomics/lack of tokens for exposure to Eliza? 
  - Reading Ape: Many people share the opinion that the tokenomics or lack thereof are confusing, not sure what to bet on for the best exposure to Eliza. Suggestions like LP could provide clarity if ai16z is THE token for exposure to the overall ecosystem. This question remains unresolved.
