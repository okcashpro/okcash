## Summary
 In the Discord chat, participants engaged in technical discussions regarding fair distribution solutions on blockchain platforms, with adi | NINJA introducing Mint.it as a unique solution for FAIR distribution using randomness from Solana blocks. The platform's educational aspect was noted to be steep due to its initial purpose of solving token generation event problems rather than education. A lighter version has been released publicly, marking the culmination of years of work on this chain and standing out as the only market solution for fair distribution onchain today.

The chat also touched upon trust scores for partners pitching pmairca, with kingdode suggesting that analyzing top Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) on Twitter to assign them trust scores could be an interesting addition. Octavian69 provided feedback on maintaining focus on actionable insights during discussions about pmairca.

Furthermore, the community discussed potential improvements and milestones for ai16z, with Rick sharing a link showing ai16z's progress in SOL holdings. DorianD suggested addressing specific issues to gain more trust within the community, referencing a Solana tracker website as an example of areas needing attention.
