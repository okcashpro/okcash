## Summary
 In the chat, DegenSpartan expressed skepticism towards non-Solana liquidity sources like Arbitrum, emphasizing Solana's dominance in their liquidity pool despite others pointing out high Total Value Locked (TVL) on different chains. The discussion shifted to the spot ecosystem's relevance and potential market impact through social media engagement by influential figures such as Marc Andreessen. DegenSpartan showed disinterest in current trends, preferring entertainment like Ergo Proxy.

The conversation then turned towards enhancing liquidity for AI16Z's Raydium LP, which is community-owned. The participants considered integrating Daos.fun into Jupiter's routing system to bolster liquidity without sacrificing attention and trading fees on the latter platform. Baoskee mentioned a direct LP enablement feature on their platform that could generate significant fees for AI16Z, with Shaw confirming personal investments in this direction.

## FAQ
 - What is the main concern regarding liquidity in solana trading?
  - Jakubi: The primary issue is that staying only on Solana limits liquidity since TVL (Total Value Locked) on other chains are very high, which could potentially offer more opportunities for arbitrage and better overall market health.

- How does DegenSpartan view the spot ecosystem's relevance?
  - DegenSpartan: They believe that the spot ecosystem is irrelevant because most traders on Solana cannot even get a loan from a bank, implying that they do not see it as a significant factor in their trading strategy.

- What are some suggestions for increasing liquidity and visibility for AI16Z?
  - yuhki: One suggestion is to have more accounts like Marc Andreessen's being remarked on, which would make posts easier to cite and increase impact. Another idea is creating an official account for ELIZA that could post memes to boost the market.

- What are some ideas discussed by users regarding AI16Z liquidity problems?
  - kezfourtwez: They proposed integrating daos.fun into Jupiter's routing system, which would double their liquidity without affecting attention and trading fees for daos.fun. Additionally, baoskee mentioned enabling LP directly on their platform to generate more fees in the DAO.
