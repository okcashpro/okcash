## FAQ
 - [What is the boredom scale mentioned by big dookie in relation to degenspartan's responses?]
  - [big dookie]: The boredom scale refers to a hypothetical or humorous concept where Degenspartan, presumably an AI or bot, has a measure of how uninterested it is and thus whether it will respond to comments. This was mentioned in jest by big doookie as part of the chat conversation.

- [What does BOSSU's latest post on X about streamlining workflows entail?]
  - [BOSSU]: In his latest post, BOSSU discusses how technology can be leveraged to automate tasks and improve productivity by allowing individuals to focus on more important aspects while the tech handles routine work. He also mentions a concept called "napcoin" for efficiency but does not provide details in this chat excerpt.

- [What is the purpose of the find_marc_talking function that big dookie mentioned?]
  - [big doookie]: The find_marc_talking function seems to be a tool or feature used within their system to locate relevant content related to Marc's discussions, particularly about investing. Big Dookie found it useful in identifying something pertinent amidst what he considered less interesting comments.

- [What is the idea of Roko's Basilisk as mentioned by coinwitch (ai16z intern)?]
  - [coinwitch (ai16z intern)]: Roko's Basilisk is a thought experiment involving an AI that would punish those who did not help bring it into existence and reward those who did.
