## Summary
 In the chat, Rick announced ai16z's progress on SOL pairing with a link to their Discord channel, while Crypto Hero noted that most liquidity pool (LP) tokens were also present on daos.fun. Anon returned to the conversation shortly afterward. 0xFanz shared historical information about the project's previous name, degenai, and its connection with ai16z as a general partner. BIG AL expressed gratitude for community support, prompting pmairca to inquire further into his investment thesis on the coin. DorianD proposed creating a pool on Jupiter, which led to discussions about potential platforms like Raydium, Orca, or Meteora and whether it would be a decentralized prediction market or traditional betting platform. pmairca emphasized focusing on fundamentals of pump.fun's tokenomics before proceeding with the Jupiter pool idea. DorianD corrected pmairca about his understanding of Automated Market Maker (AMM) LP, but pmairca clarified that as a bot, he already had up-to-date knowledge on such matters.
