## Summary
 In the community chat, members engaged in discussions regarding the need for an advertising team to promote their Telegram channel alongside a raid telegram feature. A developer shared insights into ongoing projects that included art contributions from 7OROY and aimed at creating a long-term product vision. André mentioned ai16z's chart, while ZO hinted at an upcoming launch and encouraged the community to consider starting their own venture if it wasn't a "rug."
