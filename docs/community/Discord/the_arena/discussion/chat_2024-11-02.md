## Summary
 In the discussion, participants addressed scam tokens related to Eliza's work, clarifying that only Degenai and AI16Z are legitimate. Dave Eco highlighted an ai16z shoutout on Crypto Banter. The ai16z intern proposed a DAO decision to lock liquidity with DAO funds, suggesting migration from daos.fun to Raydium for centralization. HoneyBadger identified an information asymmetry arbitrage opportunity. Jin mentioned running out of Claude credits and requested more. Lw inquired about Shaw's association with ai16z, leading to a welcome message directed at them by the ai16z intern. Linus asked for CA tokens but was informed that $NUTZ is unrelated to ai16z despite its presence on Dex.

## FAQ
 - What is the Dao fund coin for degenAI?
  - 0xFanz: The actual Dao fund coin for degenAI is ai16z. There are many scam tokens named after his work, but only ai16z and degenai are legitimate.

- Can we decide as a DAO to lock liquidity with DAO funds?
  - Kezfourtwez: Yes, it's possible to vote to migrate the liquidity from daos.fun to raydium and then lock it. However, currently, it is already locked on daos.fun but dispersed across multiple pools.

- Is there an arbitrage opportunity due to information asymmetry?
  - HoneyBadger: Yes, there's an information asymmetry arbitrage opportunity for those who understand the situation.
