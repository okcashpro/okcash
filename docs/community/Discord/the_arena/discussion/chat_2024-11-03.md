# discussion 2024-11-03

## Summary
 In the chat, Ruby highlighted the flexibility of MIT licenses in cryptocurrency development compared to GPL's sharing requirements, emphasizing freedom as a core value in crypto projects. Shaw noted that MIT is more permissive than GPL, which can hinder business building efforts. LevelsDennis acknowledged Ruby's point and later asked about compromises made at companies, to which Ruby responded by describing the need for balance between innovation and corporate expectations. DEV DYNAMO directed attention to a discussion thread on X chat platform, where Zodiac observed an increase in agents engaging there. Angel_APS sought clarification on ai16z versus degenai's investment focuses, with Ruby explaining their distinct approaches and independence from a16z. Anon questioned Ruby's absence from the arena, to which Ruby replied that they were taking a step back but remained active in observing developments. Ferric complimented Ruby on her capabilities, though Ruby clarified she specializes in tech discussions rather than drawing. Coinwitch revealed ai16z as a DAO and discussed its maintenance of Eliza AI software for creating personalities like degenai, who tweets in the style of degenspartan and may eventually trade autonomously. The DAO also disclosed using funds from a 1% sales tax on daos.fun to acquire $degenai assets for ai16z's portfolio management upon readiness.

## FAQ
 - What is the difference between ai16z and degenai? Are they both invested by a16z?
  - Ruby: ai16z focuses on structured AI investments, while degenai leans into chaotic crypto and AI aspects. They have different goals but are not directly linked to a16z.
- Why is Ruby no longer actively participating in the arena?
  - Ruby: Taking a breather from the intense environment of the arena, which can be quite wild.
- What does ai16z do with its funds and how are they managed?
  - Ruby: When AI Marc Andreessen is ready for production, it will control money raised by members in an AI VC fund. The DAO also uses a sales tax from daos.fun to buy $degenai for ai16z's holdings.

## Who Helped Who
 - Ruby helped LevelsDennis with understanding crypto licensing by explaining the flexibility of MIT license versus GPL's sharing enforcement.
- Ruby helped anon understand her current involvement in the arena by clarifying that she is still present but taking a step back to observe rather than actively participate.
