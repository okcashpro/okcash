## Summary
 During the chat, coinwitch (ai16z intern) suggested that due to low demand for certain cryptocurrencies on Layer 1 networks, it would be more cost-effective to invest in $botto instead of DeGenAi. They also discussed creating an image generating Twitter bot using generative art platforms like p5js and ThreeJS. Whobody expressed confusion about the project's direction but eventually acknowledged that the community members were multiskilled and capable of handling various aspects, including potentially developing a meme-generating AI based on trending topics from Twitter agents. Chakal humorously referred to someone as "broccoli hed guy," while shaw praised the quality and alignment of new acquaintances within the community.

## FAQ
 - What is the issue with degenai not working?
  - whobody: It seems like someone might have knowledge on how to resolve this issue but no clear solution has been provided yet.

- How can one afford gas for transactions on L1, considering its high cost and low demand?
  - coinwitch (ai16z intern): Advises against using L1 due to the high transaction costs and suggests buying $botto instead as a more economical option.

- What is gen art or ab in relation to p5js threejs, and how can it be used for creating generative art?
  - coinwitch (ai16z intern): Gen art refers to generative art using AI algorithms like P5JS ThreeJS, which could potentially create unique outputs based on input data such as memes or tweets.

- How does one go about training a model for an image generating Twitter bot?
  - whobody: Suggests the need to train a model with relevant data and then package it into the bot, although specific steps are not detailed in this conversation.

## Who Helped Who
 - coinwitch (ai16z intern) helped whobody with understanding generative art by explaining it as "gen art aka ab aka p5js threejs" and suggesting an image generating Twitter bot.
- ABadBadMan helped whobody with clarifying the project idea by mentioning feeding dallee or a generative art platform with meme data based on tweets from a Twitter agent.

## Action Items
 - Technical Tasks
  - Train a model on meme data and package it into an image-generating Twitter bot (mentioned by whobody)
  - Watch the dev stream for learning purposes (suggested by coinwitch (ai16z intern))

- Documentation Needs
  - None explicitly requested.

- Feature Requests
  - Generate generative art based on Twitter agent's tweets and memes (suggested by ABadBadMan)

- Community Tasks
  - Hype the dev stream to attract more viewers, especially focusing on popular figures like baoskee and threadguy (suggested by coinwitch (ai16z intern))
