## FAQ
 - What is the main issue with shaw's involvement in streams?
  - [badvacation]: Shaw needs to build trust using his real name instead of focusing on streams that may not be contributing effectively towards AI16z's goals.

- How does crltn (oyabunnilio) view the public sentiment regarding ai16z?
  - [crltn (oyabunnilio)]: Public sentiment is negative, but when looking deeper, it doesn't align with what ai16z aims to achieve; they should be seen as more than just an individual agent.

- What does crltn (oyabunnilio) suggest about the pace of development at AI16Z?
  - [crltn (oyabunnilio)]: They believe that ai16z's progress is slower because they operate in isolation, unlike other projects like Zerebro and Goat. Moving towards an open-source base could help them ship faster.

- What was the reason for the 40% drop mentioned by ~ CryptO_QuesT ~?
  - [crltn (oyabunnilio)]: The drop might be related to Jeff's statement that it would take Zerebro about three weeks for Twitter Open End integration.

- How does eyjay 👁🦉👁 view the impact of certain individuals on Solana?
  - [eyejay 👁🦉👁]: They believe that some personalities, like those with "Solana onchain psychos with broccoli hair," are not elevating the game and should be ignored in favor of more interesting contributors.
