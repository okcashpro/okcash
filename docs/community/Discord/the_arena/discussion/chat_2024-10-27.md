# discussion 2024-10-27

## Summary
 In the discussion, GvllyGambit highlighted that there's more potential gain than risk in a new venture, while coinwitch confirmed that profits from an AI-driven fund would support decentralized finance (DeFi) initiatives and benefit token holders. Chris sought clarity on the real-time visibility of trades made by the AI and its impact on token prices; coinwitch assured him that a dashboard was in development for transparency, and profitable trading would likely boost sentiment without directly affecting the DAO token price. The fund's lifespan is one year as per daos.fun's setup, but there are considerations to extend it. DEMIAN | DAPPCRAFT | ai2^4z revealed that their AI agent intentionally caused a market dip for strategic buying opportunities. HiroP expressed curiosity about the community, and hiroP directed Lucasvu to an external resource for further information on the project's progress.

## FAQ
 - Is there an easy way to see the trades the AI makes in real time?
  - [coinwitch (ai16z intern)]: Yes, we'll have a dashboard for all that information. This will allow users to monitor the trading activity of the fund and understand how decisions are made by the AI.

- Does the profit generated by the AI affect coin price?
  - [coinwitch (ai16z intern)]: No, profitable trades won't directly impact the coin price. However, successful trading activity may improve sentiment for the token and potentially influence its value indirectly through market perceptions.

- How long does this fund last?
  - [coinwitch (ai16z intern)]: The DAO token was set up on daos.fun to last one year, but there could be plans to extend that duration in the future.

- What happens if you hold the DAO token when the fund ends after a year?
  - [coinwitch (ai16z intern)]: If you are holding the token at the end of the fund's one-year period, you will receive a payout from the funds' holdings. This means that investors can potentially benefit from the AI trading activity even after the initial timeframe has ended.

## Who Helped Who

- coinwitch (ai16z intern) helped chris with clarifying the duration of the DAO token's trading activity impact on its price, stating it was set up to last 1 year but could potentially be extended.
