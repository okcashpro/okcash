## Summary
 In the discussion, participants engaged in technical deliberations regarding the integration of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) DAO addresses for ai16z projects on base or eth platforms, with no address provided yet but a consensus on its necessity. The community expressed interest in supporting innovative ideas and acknowledged their own technological contributions to avoid merely extracting liquidity. Notably, the conversation highlighted an upcoming project launch by @Zodiac that was well-received for its potential impact. Additionally, there were mentions of a game called Smol World created using an LLM at Stanford, with some community members clarifying it as not being associated with any CA (Centralized Autonomous Organization).
