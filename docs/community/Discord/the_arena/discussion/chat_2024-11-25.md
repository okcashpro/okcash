## Summary
 In the late hours of the night, boom initiated a project focused on enhancing music creation with Suno's instruments by extracting them and adding Grimes to the mixes, which were recently upgraded for better sound quality in version 4. The team discussed using WSL2 for Windows users and considered incorporating Eliza as a voice option into persona, potentially expanding their multimedia content to include video shorts or cartoons that could be shared on a repository. Whobody expressed interest in the project's direction, while Zardique humorously announced "utility boys" with CZ having spoken, and Rick shared a tweet from cz_binance about preparation for utility agents. Infinite redirected attention back to AI agent development.
