## FAQ

  - Danilson: Asked if it's legitimate after noticing a significant drop in value from $2.5 million to $900,000. @8550 responded with an emoji indicating uncertainty or lack of knowledge on the matter.

- Why did Remus AI16z logo change?
  - astrid: Noticed that Shaw doesn't want the ai16z logo on Eliza, so they have options for less prominent branding to stay in line with this preference. This was shared as a detail after listening to various streams and podcasts about the project.
