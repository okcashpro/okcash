# memes-and-marketing 2024-11-05

## Summary
 In the Discord chat, Futjr suggested cross-posting memes to TikTok and potentially recording nightly dev sessions on YouTube, despite acknowledging their own lack of skill in social media management (SMM). Whobody agreed that YouTube was less relevant for meme content but found value in talks. DorianD noted the limited wallet support for Token 2022 compared to SPL tokens and mentioned early adopters like Backpack Wallet and Solflare, with Phantom Wallet offering partial support. The discussion then shifted towards a dataset created by naturevrm, which was praised as fantastic but noted issues with the model's training due to excessive camera focus in images. Astrid asked about making TikTok content accessible and shared a link for community rules and links. Praulio encouraged adding audio explanations, while Poe expressed interest in creating IRL marketing materials like stickers and giveaways on campus, inquiring about the creation process of such assets. Kimidan_ raised concerns over Mintable resolution delays affecting token purchases, which Blinky reminded was addressed earlier in a different channel discussion.

## FAQ
