 In the chat, YoungPhlo confirmed their online presence to Jin, who offered to upload documents for a presentation that included recent streams as learning opportunities.

Barry Drew shared Cassie Waves' Twitter link about AI16z's new initiative on the Ethereum Foundation website. Rick later highlighted this tweet, emphasizing its recency.
