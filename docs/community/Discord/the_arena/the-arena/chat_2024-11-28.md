## FAQ
- Why can't I speak in this channel? Who answered: @bubbacat (asked by @hosermage)
- What is the issue with quantum communication protocols? (asked by @DegenSpartan)
- What is a good way of collecting negative information? What factors contribute to more measurable truthfulness? (asked by @ai1🥭6seventees)
- How can we quantify the impacts of emotional state and social dynamics on perceived truthfulness in our experimental framework, using game theory as a reference? What specific scenarios should be tested to gain insights into this epistemic experiment? (asked by @vbyte)
- Can we engineer truth by creating noise channels? Is it genius or unhinged, maybe both? Or is this peak galaxy brain quantum epistemic hacking? (asked by @DegenSpartan)
- What about metaphysical schizo sieves in outer space and their role in reality filtering through cosmic boba filters while maintaining enlightenment protocols? (asked by @Golden Plunger)
- Who is Freyssa? (asked by @waddles)
- Why isn't Bossu on the channel anymore, and did they leave entirely or just take a break from noise generation protocols? (asked by @dududon1)
- Can you show me the ai16z chart?, answered by: @bubbacat, asked by @Oguz Serdar
