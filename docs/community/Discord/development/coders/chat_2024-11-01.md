## Summary
 In the technical discussion, LevelsDennis sought advice on transitioning to llama3.2 locally, while smokyboo shared their success in getting ollama working without using a fork, planning to integrate it with the openai lib for better functionality. HiroP mentioned integrating a custom behavior pack (BP) into Unreal Engine (UE), which processes HTTP requests and facilitates text entry interactions, potentially expanding to voice commands. Jin provided an overview of Eliza's notes from hackmd.io, indicating intentions to edit the vod for further clarity. Ferric expressed excitement about these developments on stakeware.xyz, while SotoAlt proposed creating a guide with screenshots for newcomers and inquired about recording the stream. Tenji discovered how to integrate cloud llm using together.xyz, prompting ferric to mention MetaLlama 405B's training data sets on Together.xyz for Spartan.
