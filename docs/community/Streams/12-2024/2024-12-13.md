## Summary

This Twitter Spaces event, hosted by ai16z and titled "What Did You Get Done This Week? #5", was a fast-paced update session focusing on community members' progress on projects related to the Eliza AI framework. It was designed to be more structured, focusing on concrete accomplishments of the week and quickly moving through each speaker. A key aspect was also including updates from people who didn't want to speak directly, by reading their updates from a thread.

**Structure and Goals:**

*   **Focused Updates:** The goal was to have concise updates, with emphasis on what was *actually achieved* during the week rather than broader discussions.
*   **Time Management:** The hosts aimed to keep things moving efficiently and keep the meeting within a target time frame.
*   **Inclusive Updates:** Those who didn't want to speak could post a list of their accomplishments in a reply to a tweet, and those would be read aloud at the end.
*   **Data Capture:** The event aimed to capture updates for transcription, summaries, and later documentation purposes.
*   **Community Coordination:** The updates were seen as a way to help with coordination within the AI 16z community and with future planning.
*   **Working Groups:** There were several mentions of establishing more focused working groups around topics like swarms, plugins, and security.

**Other Notable Points:**

*   **Hiring:** Several speakers mentioned that they were actively hiring for developers.
*   **Open Source:** A consistent theme was the push for open-source development and community contribution.
*   **AI Integration:**  There were many projects that were actively integrating AI agents into different platforms like Twitter, Discord, Telegram, and gaming environments.
*   **Memory and Context:**  A recurring challenge was dealing with memory limitations and ensuring agents had sufficient context for coherent responses.
*   **Iterative Refinement:**  There was a lot of focus on iteratively testing, tweaking, and improving both agent behavior and infrastructure.
*   **Eliza v2:** There was a lot of hype around the upcoming Eliza v2 release, with many teams planning to align their development with the new version.
*   **Rapid Pace:** The rapid pace of development in the Eliza ecosystem was acknowledged, with many feeling like they were "stupidly early."
*   **Community Focus:** There was also recognition of the importance of community collaboration.

Overall, this event showed a vibrant and active community rapidly developing projects using the Eliza framework. It highlighted both the significant progress made in the past week and the challenges being tackled, showcasing the potential for AI agents in diverse real world applications.


## Hot Takes

1.  **"These corporations are going to cease to exist."** - **(00:07:31)** Tim Cotton makes a bold prediction about the future of traditional corporations in the face of AI agent technology. This implies a near-term and disruptive shift.

2.  **"I think I own like all the coins on stage and in the audience."** - **(00:19:25)** Frankdegods makes a boastful claim about his holdings which may ruffle feathers, especially regarding insider trading and ethical issues.

3.  **"I'm pretty sure that's a bug. You should make a PR for that because that should be fixed. That's definitely a bug."** - **(00:11:56)** Shaw quickly calls out the small model being set as default, and pushes for action on it. This could be considered a strong take that implies a sense of urgency to fix the problem.

4.  **"The goal always will be up and running with an agent in three minutes."** - **(00:22:09)** JamesYoung makes a claim about what is achievable with their tooling that may be too simplistic for some devs, and could be hard to reach with all the nuances and API keys they would need.

5.  **"We think that IP is the native asset ingested by and produced by agents like Eliza."** - **(01:10:26)** Jacob Tucker frames intellectual property as the core fuel for AI agents, which is a strong claim with implications about ownership and legal frameworks within AI systems and how that works with open source code.
