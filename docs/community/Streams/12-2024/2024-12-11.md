AI agents are taking the crypto world by storm, introducing unprecedented scale and efficiency to Web3. At the center of this revolution is Shaw, the creator of the Eliza framework and ai16z DAO, a groundbreaking initiative that’s reshaping decentralized investments. The ai16z DAO has rapidly gained traction, becoming the #1 trending GitHub repository last month, with over 3,300 stars and 880+ forks.

In this episode, we explore how Shaw and his team are leading a community-driven, open-source movement to integrate AI and crypto. From managing DAOs to bridging Web3 with real-world applications, we dive into how the Eliza framework is setting the groundwork for a potential AGI future. This is more than just an AI experiment—it’s the beginning of a new paradigm for both industries.
