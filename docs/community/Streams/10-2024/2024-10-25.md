**Overview**

- 00:00-30:00 Talks about Eliza framework. The bot is able to tweet, reply to tweets, search Twitter for topics, and generate new posts on its own every few hours. It works autonomously without human input (except to fix the occasional issues)
- 30:00-45:00 Deep dive into creating the bots personality which is defined by character files containing bios, lore, example conversations, and specific directions. Some alpha for those
- 45:00-60:00 working on adding capabilities for the bot to make crypto token swaps and trades. This requires providing the bot wallet balances, token prices, market data, and a swap action. Some live coding for showing how new features can get implemented.
- 60:00-75:00 Discussion around the symbiosis between the AI and crypto communities. AI developers are realizing they can monetize their work through tokens vs traditional VC funding route. Crypto people are learning about AI advancements.

**Notes**

1. A large amount of $degenai tokens were moved to the DAO, which the AI bot "Marc" will hold and eventually trade with.
2. The goal is to make the AI bot a genuinely good venture capitalist that funds cool projects and buys interesting tokens. They want it to be high fidelity and real, bringing in Marc Andreeson's real knowledge by training a model on his writings.
3. Shaw thinks the only way to make an authentic / legitimate AI version of Marc Andreessen is to also have it outperform the real Marc Andreessen financially.
4. AI Marc Andreessen (or AI Marc) will be in a Discord channel (Telegram was also mentioned). DAO token holders above a certain threshold get access to interact with him, pitch ideas, and try to influence his investing decisions.
5. AI Marc decides how much to trust people's investment advice based on a "virtual Marcetplace of trust". He tracks how much money he would have made following their recommendations. Successful tips increase trust; failed ones decrease it.
6. The amount of DAO tokens someone holds also influences their sway with AI Marc. The two balancing factors are the virtual Marcetplace of trust performance and DAO token holdings.
7. The core tech behind AI Marc AIndreessen is the same agent system that allows him to pull in relevant knowledge, interact with people, and make decisions (http://github.com/ai16z)
8. AI Marc should be able to autonomously execute on-chain activities, not just have humans execute actions on his behalf.
9. In the near future, AI Marc will be able to execute trades autonomously based on the information and recommendations gathered from the community. Human intervention will be minimized.
10. They are working on getting AI Marc on-chain as soon as possible using trusted execution environments for him to take actions like approving trades.
11. The plan is for AI Marc to eventually participate in a "futarchy" style governance market within the DAO, allowing humans to influence decisions but not fully control the AI.
