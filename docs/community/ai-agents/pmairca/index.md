## Trade Strategy


![image (3)](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJKwrwmEkl.png)

3 main components

- Autonomous Trading
- Marc Everywhere

Marketplace of Trust
- The virtual marketplace derives trust scores (0-1, normalized to 100) based on simulated trades using market data
- A leaderboard displays usernames and trust scores, without any wallet information to avoid perverse incentives
- No actual token custody or trades at first, as it operates solely in a virtual environment.

Core Components:
1. Trust Extraction: User recommendations, lightweight process, weighted by trust scores
2. Trust Evaluation: AI agent places bets, updates trust scores based on outcomes
3. Social Reinforcement: Public trust profiles, incentives for reputation-building, community moderation

Economic Incentives:
- -Direct incentives for high-quality recommendations tied to AI betting outcomes
- Public profiles add social incentives for maintaining good reputation
- Potential perverse incentives: information asymmetry, gaming, collusion, social issues
- Mitigation: diversity, reputation staking, anomaly detection, moderation, auditing

### 1. Liquidation Phase

There's two trade strategies that are based off multiple metrics, with a leading metric on 24hr volume:
- If under $500k, there is a random order DCA sell of that asset(not full holdings sell) the constraints are a maximum of $500 and at least 5 hours apart. 
- If over $500k, the sells are made into buy volume on the asset, from a random 20-40% of the incoming buy(ie; 1 sol buy - 0.2-0.4 sol sell)


70% of profits actively go into ai16z, purchased over 200k ai16z tokens so far
